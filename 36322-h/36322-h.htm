<h2><a name='chI' id='chI'></a>CHAPTER I—THE LURE OF THE BATTLESHIP</h2>
<p>
“That must be the place over there,
Sam.”
</p>
<p>
“Where?”
</p>
<p>
“Just across the street on the next block.
I see something in front of the building that
looks like the picture we saw in the post office
at home.”
</p>
<p>
Dan Davis turned to a passing policeman
and, respectfully touching his hat, asked:
</p>
<p>
“Will you tell us, sir, where we may find the
United States Navy recruiting station?”
</p>
<p>
The policeman pointed to the building in
front of which Dan’s eyes had caught sight of
a highly colored lithograph.
</p>
<p>
“Thank you, sir. Come on, Sam; I was
right. That is the place we are looking for.
See that flag up there in the third story window?
That’s the flag you and I are going to
serve under if we are lucky enough to be
accepted.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8'></a>8</span>
</p>
<p>
Sam Hickey nodded and started after his companion
across the street. A moment later the
lads stood before the picture that had attracted
their attention. In the foreground of the picture
stood a sailor clad in the uniform of a seaman
in Uncle Sam’s Navy, while on beyond
him, in the distant background, lay a white
battleship, the Stars and Stripes floating from
her after staff, a line of signal flags fluttering
from the signal halyard just aft of the battleship’s
navigating bridge. Palm trees and similar
foliage showed it to be a tropical scene.
</p>
<p>
For several moments the lads stood gazing
on the picture with fascinated interest. Each
seemed unable to withdraw his gaze from it.
At last, with a deep sigh, Dan turned his shining
eyes upon his young companion.
</p>
<p>
“Isn’t it beautiful, Sam?” he breathed.
</p>
<p>
“What, the sailor?”
</p>
<p>
“I was not thinking of the sailor; I was
thinking of the ship—the battleship—and that
Flag floating there, the most beautiful Flag in
the world. At least I guess it must be. I’ve
never seen any of the other flags, except in
pictures, but that one is handsome enough for
me. Shall we go upstairs to the recruiting
office now?”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t be in a hurry,” objected Sam. “I
want to look at the picture some more.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span>
</p>
<p>
“We can do that afterwards. The first thing
is to see whether we shall be able to enlist. This
letter that I got from the station says we have to
be examined, though I don’t know just what
sort of examination they will give us.”
</p>
<p>
Sam Hickey still lingered.
</p>
<p>
“Are you coming, Sam?”
</p>
<p>
“No.”
</p>
<p>
“Not coming?”
</p>
<p>
“No; I’ve changed my mind.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t understand,” rejoined Dan, a puzzled
expression in his eyes.
</p>
<p>
“I guess I do not want to enlist. I think I
shall go back home to Piedmont.”
</p>
<p>
“Look here, Sam Hickey, you will do nothing
of the sort! We came down here to enlist
in the Navy and that is exactly what we are
going to do, providing they will have us. You
say you are going back home. How do you
expect to get there?”
</p>
<p>
“The way we came—on a train, of course.”
</p>
<p>
Dan smiled grimly.
</p>
<p>
“I guess not. You forget that we have no
money left—that is, not more than enough
with which to buy one more meal.”
</p>
<p>
“I can walk,” grumbled Sam.
</p>
<p>
“No, you cannot. We are three hundred
miles from Piedmont. Why do you wish to
back out at this late hour? You were so anxious to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span>
enlist, and now you are talking the other
way. Why?”
</p>
<p>
“I’ve changed my mind; that’s all.”
</p>
<p>
Dan grasped his companion firmly by the
arm.
</p>
<p>
“You come along with me! You have changed
your mind too late this time.”
</p>
<p>
Sam hesitated, then reluctantly accompanied
his companion up the stairs. A few moments
later, they were knocking at the door of the
recruiting office.
</p>
<p>
Sam Hickey felt a strong inclination to bolt,
and no doubt he would have done so had it not
been for the firm grip on his arm. He ran one
hand nervously through his shock of red hair,
shifted his weight from one foot to the other
and muttered something that was unintelligible
to his companion.
</p>
<p>
But Dan’s ears were keenly alert for the response
to his summons, and he straightened up
ever so little as he heard footsteps approaching
the door.
</p>
<p>
It had been the dream of these two young
American boys for many months to join the
Navy. They had talked and talked of the day
when they should have arrived at the age that
permitted them to make application for admission
to the service. A few weeks before reaching
the legal age, which is seventeen, each had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span>
received a letter from a recruiting station in
New York City pointing out the advantages that
the service offers to young Americans.
</p>
<p>
Correspondence had been immediately opened
with the recruiting office, with the result that
the lads made their preparations to go directly
to New York City and present themselves at the
recruiting station.
</p>
<p>
Dan, who lived with his widowed mother,
was a clerk in the general store in his home
town; while Sam, an orphan, had been serving
an apprenticeship in a small machine shop. It
had been therefore no small effort for the boys
to get together enough money for their expenses
to the metropolis; and, as already stated,
they were now practically at the end of their
resources. But this did not discourage them.
</p>
<p>
“If we are rejected we shall be able to find
something to do in New York that will let us
earn enough money to take us back home,”
Dan had declared resolutely, his pale face
lighting up, his eyes sparkling with purpose
and determination.
</p>
<p>
“Yes; I had just as lief work in New York
as in Piedmont,” agreed Sam.
</p>
<p>
“I hope, Sam, we shall have to do neither.”
</p>
<p>
The door was thrown open abruptly, and the
boys found themselves confronted by a middle-aged
man clad in a blue suit. On the right
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span>
sleeve he wore three bright red chevrons enclosing
a white pilot wheel, surmounted by a
white eagle, showing that he was a quartermaster
in the United States Navy.
</p>
<p>
“Well, what is it?” he demanded rather
brusquely.
</p>
<p>
“We wish to join the Navy, sir,” answered
Dan firmly.
</p>
<p>
The quartermaster surveyed the lads keenly.
</p>
<p>
“Come inside,” he said.
</p>
<p>
The boys entered the waiting room, where
they were directed to seat themselves at a
table. A printed blank form was placed before
each.
</p>
<p>
“Fill out those applications,” directed the
petty officer who had admitted them. “If your
answers to the questions are satisfactory you
will be asked some further questions; then we
shall have you examined.”
</p>
<p>
Having spent three years in high school,
after finishing at the grammar school, the boys
found themselves well able to fill out the application
blanks without having to ask questions
of the quartermaster. This they did with much
care, giving such facts about themselves as the
application blank demanded.
</p>
<p>
Sam nudged his companion.
</p>
<p>
“See that man sitting over there to the left
of you?” he asked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“I think he must be a general or something
of the sort.”
</p>
<p>
“Humph! There’s only one general in the
Navy, and he is in the Marine Corps,” answered
Dan reprovingly. “I know what that officer is.”
</p>
<p>
“What is he, then, if you know so much?”
</p>
<p>
“He is a commander.”
</p>
<p>
“How do you know?”
</p>
<p>
“I know by the three gold stripes on his
sleeve. If he had two and a half stripes there
he would be a lieutenant-commander. If he
had four he would be a captain.”
</p>
<p>
Sam looked incredulous.
</p>
<p>
“How do you happen to know all about
that?”
</p>
<p>
“I read about it in a dictionary. They were
all pictured out there. I know a lot more of
them, too, only I’m too busy to tell you about
them now. Have you finished filling out your
blank?”
</p>
<p>
“Not quite.”
</p>
<p>
“Then you had better get busy. If we take
too much time it <em>may</em> count against us. I don’t
know about it for sure.”
</p>
<p>
For several minutes thereafter the lads wrote
industriously. Dan was the first to lay down
his pen, waiting in silence for his companion
to finish, which Sam did shortly afterwards.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>
</p>
<p>
“What shall we do now?” questioned Sam,
glancing up into the face of his friend.
</p>
<p>
“I do not know. Give me your paper and I
will hand both to the officer over there.”
</p>
<p>
Dan stepped to the commander’s desk, handing
the applications to him.
</p>
<p>
“What’s this?” demanded the commander
sharply.
</p>
<p>
“They are our applications, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Give them to the quartermaster.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir,” answered Dan respectfully, turning
away. As he did so, the eyes of the commander
were fixed inquiringly upon him.
</p>
<p>
“That is a likely looking lad,” muttered the
officer. “In fact, they both look like excellent
material—good, clean-cut American boys—just
the sort of material the United States Navy is
looking for.”
</p>
<p>
In the meantime Dan had stepped to the door
through which he had observed the petty officer
who had first greeted them, and walked towards
him.
</p>
<p>
“Here are our papers, sir. What are we to
do next?”
</p>
<p>
“Go back and sit down. I’ll tell you when
we want you.”
</p>
<p>
The quartermaster seated himself at a desk,
where he went over the applications carefully.
He looked them over a second time, nodded approvingly,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>
then glanced up quickly at the
flushed, expectant faces of the two lads.
</p>
<p>
“You men come with me,” he said, rising.
</p>
<p>
“He called us ‘men.’ Did you hear it? I
guess we are, all right,” whispered Sam.
</p>
<p>
The quartermaster conducted them into an
adjoining room, where they were turned over
to the examining surgeon, who, after scanning
their applications, began asking them pointed
questions about their parents and their life. In
fact, he asked more questions than either lad
knew how to answer, for the inquiry went
back more years than they had lived.
</p>
<p>
The examination lasted fully an hour, after
which the lads were directed to return to the
room where they had filled out their applications.
</p>
<p>
“He knows more about me than I ever
thought there was to know,” confided Sam to
his companion.
</p>
<p>
Just then the surgeon came hurrying in.
He laid their applications on the desk before
the commander, engaging in earnest conversation
with that officer.
</p>
<p>
“I think they are going to turn us out,”
whispered Dan.
</p>
<p>
“I hope they do,” grumbled Sam, brushing
a hand across his freckled cheek. “I don’t see
why they have to go through all this rigmarole. Reminds
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>
me of the time they tried a fellow
up in our place for stealing a yearling
heifer.”
</p>
<p>
“It is well worth the rigmarole if we can get
in,” answered Dan, ignoring the comparison.
“I do not care how much they put us through.
And, besides, it proves that everybody cannot
get into Uncle Sam’s Navy. A fellow has got to
be a real man if he wants to be a jackie these
days,” added Dan somewhat proudly. “I wonder
what they are talking about?”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll know in a minute. There comes that
quartermaster fellow,” answered Sam.
</p>
<p>
The lads rose as he stepped up to them.
</p>
<p>
“Have we passed?” questioned Dan, unable
to repress his anxiety.
</p>
<p>
“Your examination has been satisfactory,
but the commander desires to speak with you.
That is the commander at the roll top desk
yonder. Step over, but be very respectful. Remember,
he is an officer in the United States
Navy, and——”
</p>
<p>
“We are not likely to forget that we are
young gentlemen, sir,” interrupted Dan, flushing
slightly.
</p>
<p>
The lads walked over to the commander’s
desk, where Dan, with heels together, made a
correct military salute, raising the right hand
smartly till the tip of the forefinger touched
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>
the forehead just above the right eye, then
dropping the arm smartly to his side.
</p>
<p>
Sam did the same, but rather more clumsily.
</p>
<p>
Instantly the commander’s right hand went
up in a return salute, while the faces of the
boys flushed rosy red.
</p>
<p>
“You have had some previous military instruction?”
asked the commander, with a twinkle
in his eyes.
</p>
<p>
“Nothing very much, sir,” replied Dan.
“We belong to the village fire company at
home—that is all.”
</p>
<p>
The commander smiled.
</p>
<p>
“You are a pair of very likely lads.”
</p>
<p>
“Have we passed, sir?”
</p>
<p>
“You have.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I’m so glad!” breathed Dan, unable to
conceal his delight.
</p>
<p>
“Then—then we are in the Navy?” stammered
Sam.
</p>
<p>
“Not quite. You will be, very soon, providing
you have fulfilled all the requirements.”
</p>
<p>
“What are we to do?”
</p>
<p>
“Have you the consent—the written consent—of
your parents?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir. That is, I have my mother’s consent.
My friend, Sam, here, has no parents.”
</p>
<p>
“Has he a guardian?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>
</p>
<p>
“And has his guardian given his written consent
also?”
</p>
<p>
“He has, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Let me have both of them.”
</p>
<p>
The papers were handed to the commander,
who perused them carefully.
</p>
<p>
“How did you lads chance to come so well
prepared?”
</p>
<p>
“We had written to find out, so that we
might not be disappointed when we got here.
We could not afford to make the trip back home,
so we did what we could before coming on.”
</p>
<p>
“You did well. Young men, I am proud to
see lads of your type entering the service. I
predict for you both a rapid rise. You will,
of course, meet with hardships. These are a
part of the life, but it is a noble career, and if
you are the lads I believe you to be you will
overcome all these things. You have in you
the making of splendid men, and the United
States Navy will surely bring out every dormant
good quality that you may possess.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you, sir; we shall do our best,” answered
Dan.
</p>
<p>
“I am sure of that.”
</p>
<p>
“What are we to do now, if it is proper to
ask?”
</p>
<p>
“You will be furnished with transportation
to Newport, R. I., where you will go to-night.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>
You will enter the apprentice training school
there. After a course of three months, if qualified,
you will be given an assignment on one
of the ships of the fleet. You understand, you
will enter the training school as apprentices.
While there you will receive a salary of seventeen
dollars and sixty cents a month. Your
board and lodging, of course, will be furnished
by the government, as will your uniforms and
equipment.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you, sir,” reiterated Dan.
</p>
<p>
The commander then administered the oath
of allegiance to the lads in slow, impressive
tones, while they stood rigidly at attention,
their eyes fixed upon his.
</p>
<p>
“You will now report to the quartermaster,”
announced the commander after the lads had
subscribed to the oath. “I shall expect to hear
good reports from you, my lads.” He cordially
extended a hand to each, much to the amazement
of the quartermaster, who never had seen
his commander do that to an apprentice before.
</p>
<p>
The remaining details were disposed of in a
very few minutes thereafter, and the boys made
their way downstairs, out into the street, light-hearted
and happy.
</p>
<p>
“Look!” cried Dan, pointing off to the East
River.
</p>
<p>
“What is it?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>
</p>
<p>
“It’s a war ship. I wonder which one it is.
Can you tell me, sir, what ship that is?” asked
Dan of a passer-by.
</p>
<p>
“That is the United States battleship
‘Idaho,’” was the answer.
</p>
<p>
“I wonder if we ever will be placed on a ship
like that,” mused Dan, gazing in fascinated
interest at the slow-moving vessel as she plowed
her way under the Brooklyn bridge, heading
for the open sea.
</p>
<p>
Dan Davis drew a long sigh.
</p>
<p>
“Come,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“Where?”
</p>
<p>
“Somewhere where we can spend our last
fifty cents for a meal. That will be the last
meal we shall have until we get to Newport.
Then we will look about some. We have several
hours before the boat leaves. We shall
probably get lost the first thing we do, but we
have plenty of time in which to find ourselves,”
added Dan, with a short laugh.
</p>
<p>
Naturally, the ships that lined one side of
South Street, along which they were strolling,
held the greatest interest for them. There
were sailing ships from the four quarters of
the globe, tramp steamers, coasters from
southern ports, interspersed with ferry boats
and tug boats of every size and class. There
was such a confusion of craft that the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>
boys could scarcely make out one from the
other.
</p>
<p>
They had reached a cross street, up which
they decided to turn, having learned that it
would lead them to Broadway, which thoroughfare
they were anxious to see, when there occurred
an interruption that changed their plans
entirely for the time being.
</p>
<p>
Sam had paused beside a little two-wheeled
cart to purchase an apple from an old woman
who had asked him to buy. He had just handed
over his nickel for the apple when a crowd of
firemen from a tramp steamer came rolling up
the street, the grime of the stoke hole still on
their faces.
</p>
<p>
Freed from the restraint of their floating
prison, the men were hilarious and bent on mischief.
But neither of the lads observed them,
nor did they hear the shouts and songs of the
stokers above the roar of the traffic in the busy
street.
</p>
<p>
The first intimation the boys had that trouble
was abroad was when a hulking stoker let
fly a heavily booted foot at the little apple
wagon.
</p>
<p>
His aim was true. Up shot the wagon, apples
flying in all directions, showering over the
heads of the lads and into the muddy gutter.
The apple wagon itself turned bottom upward,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>
landing fairly on the head of the aged woman,
carrying her down with it, and flattening her
in the gutter amid the ruin of her precious
wares.
</p>
<p>
Sam wheeled like a flash. The freckles on
his now pale face seemed to stand out like scars.
</p>
<p>
Without an instant’s hesitation he let go a
fist.
</p>
<p>
It caught the stoker fairly on the side of the
jaw. The fellow dropped as if he had been
shot, his face burrowing in the mud of the gutter,
where he lay motionless for a few seconds.
</p>
<p>
So astonished were his companions that for
the moment they stood gaping. Then the humor
of the situation seemed to strike them all at
once. All hands broke out into a roar of mirth.
That a slender lad should have put out one of
their number was to them a huge joke.
</p>
<p>
Just as soon as he got over his bewilderment
at having been so easily handled by a boy, the
stoker got to his feet.
</p>
<p>
He did not immediately follow up his intention
of soundly trouncing that forward youngster.
This for the very simple reason that the
stoker had gone down on his face in the mud.
Now he held more than a mouthful of that plastic
stuff. Growling, the stoker thrust two fingers
of one hand into his mouth, trying to force
the sticky mess out.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>
</p>
<p>
“Fine, isn’t it?” jeered Sam, cocking his
head on one side and leering comically.
</p>
<p>
“What?” queried one of the stoker’s own
mates, for the one who had just struggled to
his feet could not speak.
</p>
<p>
“Mud pies, of course,” grinned Sam.
“Healthful, nourishing and great food, for they
make you think and work. But only a hog
would gulp down a mouthful like that.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll—whoof—make you eat some—ugh!—of
that—br-r-r!—blamed—waugh!—mud pie—gr-r-r!—o’
your’n!” raged the humiliated
stoker as he pawed out the last remnants of
that muddy mouthful.
</p>
<p>
Of a sudden the stoker, crouching low, made
a vengeful bolt forward. But he did not catch
Sam Hickey unawares. That young man
dodged, then landed a second and harder blow
on the fellow’s jaw. This time Mr. Stoker
struck the mud puddle, again face downward,
with a force that made the man fairly bury
his face in the ooze.
</p>
<p>
“Last call to the dining car!” yelled Sam,
dancing about. “Gone back for a second helping
of mud pie! Wow, but it’s good!”
</p>
<p>
This time the stoker did not regain his feet
quite so soon. He had measured his full length
in the gutter again, where he lay stretched out,
none of his companions making an effort to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>
assist their fallen shipmate nor to avenge the
blow that had laid him low.
</p>
<p>
“Right hot off the bat,” jeered the stokers.
</p>
<p>
The fallen man was making desperate efforts
to pull himself together when a policeman laid
a heavy hand on Sam Hickey’s collar.
</p>
<p>
“That’s the time I caught you in the act,
young man. You come with me!” commanded
the officer sternly.
</p>
<p>
“You leggo of me! I’ll do nothing of the
sort,” retorted the lad belligerently, struggling
to free himself, surprised at his inability to
throw off the officer’s grip. It was Sam’s first
experience with a New York policeman.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, let the kid go,” shouted the crowd.
“He’s all right. He is a winner, even if he did
hand it out to a shipmate.”
</p>
<p>
Dan edged his way around in front of the
policeman. He saw that Sam’s lips were set
tight and knew that this meant trouble.
</p>
<p>
“Take it easy, Sam,” warned Dan in a low
tone. “Officer, this boy has done nothing worse
than to punish a ruffian. It is the other man
whom you ought to arrest, if anyone.”
</p>
<p>
“What’s this you say? Don’t you dare interfere
with an officer, young man, or in you go!”
</p>
<p>
“I am not interfering, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“You are, but you’d better not.”
</p>
<p>
“I am just trying to explain. That fellow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>
there, picking himself up from the ground,
kicked the old apple woman’s wagon into the
air. See, she’s just crawling out from under it
now. I should not be surprised if she were
hurt. Pretty much all her wares are spoiled,
as you can see for yourself.”
</p>
<p>
“He did——”
</p>
<p>
“My friend Sam punched the fellow, but the
man deserved it. I should have done it myself
if he had not, though I am sure I could not have
done so thorough a job.”
</p>
<p>
“You—you say the stoker there kicked the
old woman’s cart over?” questioned the policeman.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“And your friend handed him one for it?”
</p>
<p>
“<em>Two</em> of them.”
</p>
<p>
“And who are you fellows, anyway?”
</p>
<p>
Dan gave the officer their names and addresses.
</p>
<p>
“What are you doing here?”
</p>
<p>
“We are sailors in the United States Navy,”
answered Dan proudly. “We are on our way
to the training station at Newport. You had
better not detain us, or there may be trouble.”
</p>
<p>
The policeman grinned broadly.
</p>
<p>
“Beat it, then,” he commanded, giving Sam
a sudden shove that excited that young man’s
anger somewhat. “Get out of here both of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>
you, before I run you in for disturbing the
peace. Here, you stokers, you clear out, too,
and don’t you let me catch you raising any
more rows on my beat or your ship will sail
without you when she goes out again. Off
with you!”
</p>
<p>
While all this had been happening, the old
apple woman had been busily engaged in gathering
her stock in trade. The loss of a few dozen
apples would have been serious to her. But
now she hobbled toward Hickey, resting a withered
hand on his coat sleeve.
</p>
<p>
“I—I don’t know how to thank you, young
man,” she quavered.
</p>
<p>
“I’m glad you don’t, ma’am,” answered
Sam, uncovering as quickly as though the little
old woman had been an admiral’s wife. “The
thanks of the ladies always embarrass me,
ma’am. But I’m glad I settled your bill against
that sea-going miner.”
</p>
<p>
Now the two brand-new fighting men of the
Navy edged quickly away from the crowd that
was growing every instant.
</p>
<p>
“Come on, Sam,” urged Dan. “Let’s go
over and take a look at Broadway,” linking his
arm within that of his companion and leading
him from the scene. “We have begun our
fighting career rather early, it strikes me.”
</p>
<p>
“No; I’ve changed my mind. I don’t want
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>
to go to Broadway,” objected Sam, pulling
back.
</p>
<p>
“What do you wish to do?” demanded Dan
suspiciously.
</p>
<p>
“I want to hang around here and see the
fun,” answered Hickey.
</p>
<p>
“Right about face! March!” commanded
Dan.
</p>
<p>
Sam eyed his companion resentfully, then,
turning sharply about, fell into a military
stride, with his face turned toward Broadway.
</p>
<h2><a name='chII' id='chII'></a>CHAPTER II—IN UNCLE SAM’S NAVY</h2>
<p>
“Do you know where you are going?”
</p>
<p>
“No, but I shall find out pretty
soon, Sam.”
</p>
<p>
Dan Davis paused, pointing off over the beautiful
Narragansett Bay to where the cage masts
of two big battleships were observable, towering
high above a point of land.
</p>
<p>
“Do you see them?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“Who knows but we may be on one of those
ships in three months from now. I wish we
were going there to-day.”
</p>
<p>
The lads were standing on a rise of ground
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>
just in front of the executive building of the
Newport, R. I., training station. A long, green
lawn sloped down to the water’s edge where a
fleet of cutters belonging to the station, swayed
idly at their moorings. On beyond, lay the old
“Constitution,” fully rigged, a handsome craft
despite the fact that more than a hundred years
had elapsed since she left the hands of her builders.
The boys did not know her name, but they
did know that she belonged to another age. To
the right, lay the “Cumberland,” a full rigged
sailing ship; the “Boxer,” a barkentine, and
some distance from the latter they saw moored
to a wharf the “Reina Mercedes,” captured
during the war with Spain.
</p>
<p>
Dan’s eyes lighted up and his face glowed with
pleasure.
</p>
<p>
“Beautiful!” he breathed.
</p>
<p>
“It might be if I had some breakfast inside
of me,” answered Sam Hickey. “We haven’t
had a thing to eat since we had that plate of
ham and eggs in New York yesterday. I’m
hungry enough to eat anything.”
</p>
<p>
The hour was still early, and few of the apprentices
of the training school were to be seen
on the grounds of the station.
</p>
<p>
“Then come along. We will see whether we
can find some one to direct us.”
</p>
<p>
The lads started on again. As they came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>
abreast of the flagstaff from which floated the
Stars and Stripes, Dan halted. Coming to attention
he saluted the Flag respectfully.
</p>
<p>
Sam Hickey grinned, but he did not salute.
</p>
<p>
“Why do you do that every time?” he questioned.
</p>
<p>
“Because it is the Flag of our country, Sam.
Always salute the Flag whenever you see it.
You will find that we shall be expected to do so
from this time on.”
</p>
<p>
“You never did that to the Flag in front
of the High School at home.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps I did not know then,” answered
Dan, with a smile.
</p>
<p>
They moved on, gazing about them with the
keenest interest. A moment later Dan caught
sight of an officer, clad completely in white, approaching
them at a brisk pace.
</p>
<p>
“I’m going to ask him where we should go,”
said Sam.
</p>
<p>
“No; let me do that. I am afraid you will
make a mess of it,” laughed Dan. “Officers
are very particular as to how they are addressed.
Perhaps I shan’t do it right, but I think I know
how it ought to be done.”
</p>
<p>
Sam muttered something that his companion
did not catch. In fact, Dan was not listening.
His eyes were fixed on the dignified figure approaching
them. When within eight or ten
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>
paces of the officer Dan halted, raising his right
hand in salute as he came to attention.
</p>
<p>
The salute was answered by the officer, who,
noting that the boy wished to speak to him, also
halted.
</p>
<p>
“What is it, my lad?” he demanded in a sharp,
incisive tone.
</p>
<p>
“We are new recruits, sir. Will you kindly
direct us where to go?”
</p>
<p>
“When did you get in?”
</p>
<p>
“This morning.”
</p>
<p>
“From what station?”
</p>
<p>
“We enlisted at the recruiting office in South
Street, New York, sir.”
</p>
<p>
The officer surveyed them inquiringly for a
moment. His examination evidently was satisfying,
for he nodded approvingly.
</p>
<p>
“You will go to the detention barracks first.”
</p>
<p>
“Will you kindly tell me where that is, sir?”
</p>
<p>
“Follow this walk. The detention barracks
is the third building on your left.”
</p>
<p>
“Whom shall we ask for, sir?”
</p>
<p>
“Inquire for Chief Quartermaster Broder, if
you do not see him at once. He will probably
see you first, however. You had better make
haste, for the men are about ready for breakfast
there.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir; thank you, sir,” answered Dan,
saluting and moving on.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>
</p>
<p>
“My, he’s so full of dignity it’s a wonder he
doesn’t explode,” commented Sam, after they
had gone on a few steps.
</p>
<p>
“He has a right to be dignified,” replied Dan.
</p>
<p>
“How so?”
</p>
<p>
“He is a captain in the United States Navy.
I would rather be that than President of the
United States.”
</p>
<p>
“Does he earn as much money as the president
does?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no; not by a great many thousand dollars.”
</p>
<p>
“Then me for the presidency,” concluded the
irrepressible Sam.
</p>
<p>
“There’s the barracks.”
</p>
<p>
A few minutes later the lads presented themselves
at the door of the detention barracks.
They were met by an officer wearing the insignia
of a chief quartermaster.
</p>
<p>
“Are you Mr. Broder, sir?” asked Dan.
</p>
<p>
“Yes; who are you?”
</p>
<p>
“My name is Dan Davis. My companion is
Sam Hickey. We enlisted in New York yesterday.
We have come to report for instruction.”
</p>
<p>
“Where are your papers?”
</p>
<p>
The lad presented them.
</p>
<p>
After reading the papers, the quartermaster
turned on his heel.
</p>
<p>
“Come with me,” he said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>
</p>
<p>
The boys were conducted to a bathroom, where
they were directed to disrobe and take a shower
bath. After the bath, they were once more examined
by a surgeon, who pronounced them to
be in splendid physical condition.
</p>
<p>
Sam’s face wore a smile. It was all highly
amusing to him, but when the quartermaster
finally conducted them to another room, where
several uniforms were laid out on a table, the
boy began to feel a keener interest.
</p>
<p>
The petty officer glanced over the display of
clothes, then picking out two suits, handed them
to the lads.
</p>
<p>
“Put these on,” he said, “then report to me.”
</p>
<p>
It did not take the boys long to get into their
new white uniforms.
</p>
<p>
“I wish I had a looking glass,” grumbled
Sam.
</p>
<p>
“What for? I can tell you how you look.”
</p>
<p>
“How do I look?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, barring the freckles, you look as if you
might be a jackie some day. But don’t stand
there with your shoulders slouched forward.
Stand up and act as if you were proud of the
uniform you are wearing. Here, we haven’t
put on our leggins yet.”
</p>
<p>
“Leggins? Do we wear those things?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. Otherwise we shall be dressed just like
the sailors on the war ships.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>
</p>
<p>
At that moment the quartermaster entered.
He stood surveying them critically.
</p>
<p>
“What shall we do with our citizen clothes?”
asked Dan.
</p>
<p>
“Leave them. I will have them taken care of.
Do you wish them sent to your homes?”
</p>
<p>
“No, sir; it is not necessary. I presume we
shall be permitted to take them aboard ship with
us when we leave here?”
</p>
<p>
“That depends upon what ship you join.”
</p>
<p>
“What are we to do now, sir?”
</p>
<p>
“In the first place I will instruct you about
your clothing. These bags here will answer for
your trunks. All your belongings will be kept
in them,” said the quartermaster, exhibiting
two canvas bags, about three feet long, and on
which the names of the boys had been stamped
with a stencil. “Each piece of clothing must be
folded neatly, rolled up tightly and secured with
a white cotton stop two inches from the end of
the roll.”
</p>
<p>
Sam measured off what he thought to be two
inches with his fingers.
</p>
<p>
“The clothes are to be stowed in the bags in
layers of three pieces, each layer at right angles
to the one below it.”
</p>
<p>
“What’s all that for? Why not stuff them in
till the bag’s full?” interrupted Sam.
</p>
<p>
The petty officer fixed him with a stern eye.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span>
</p>
<p>
“Don’t ask unnecessary questions, young
man,” rebuked the officer, whereat Sam subsided.
</p>
<p>
“Is there any system, other than what you
have spoken of, for stowing the clothes, sir?”
questioned Dan respectfully.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. I’ll explain. Place the blue clothes
and cap in the bottom of the bag, white clothes
and hats next, small bags, socks and other articles
on top. Secure the bag with two turns of
the lanyard as close down on the contents as possible—this
way. Do you understand?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir; thank you, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“That will be all for the present. Have you
had your breakfast?”
</p>
<p>
“No, sir, and we’re half starved,” spoke up
Sam Hickey quickly. “I could eat a horse.”
</p>
<p>
“No comments, please. Remember, men, you
are now full fledged rookies. You are in the
service of the United States Government and you
must remember to conduct yourselves accordingly.
I will see that you get further instruction
after breakfast.”
</p>
<p>
The bugle was blowing the breakfast call at
that moment. The quartermaster conducted the
lads outside the building and around into another
apartment where a group of white-uniformed
young fellows were standing about waiting for
the command to seat themselves at the tables.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>
</p>
<p>
“Fall to!” commanded the officer.
</p>
<p>
There followed a rattling of dishes and a
scraping of feet as the apprentices seated themselves
at the long table, each with a keen zest
for his morning meal.
</p>
<h2><a name='chIII' id='chIII'></a>CHAPTER III—WHO THREW THE PIE?</h2>
<p>
The breakfast consisted of creamed chipped
beef, potatoes and hot corn bread,
topped off with apple pie.
</p>
<p>
“This looks good to me,” muttered Sam
Hickey in a low tone, because out of the corners
of his eyes he saw the quartermaster observing
him attentively.
</p>
<p>
After they were well started on the meal, the
officer left the room in order that the new boys
might get acquainted, which would not be likely
as long as he was in the room.
</p>
<p>
“Hullo, red-head!” greeted an apprentice
across the table from Sam. “What might be
your name?”
</p>
<p>
“It might be ‘most anything, only it isn’t.
I’m Sam Hickey; who are you?”
</p>
<p>
“Louis Flink. Where you from?”
</p>
<p>
“Piedmont. Where do you live when you are
at home?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>
</p>
<p>
“Pennsylvania.”
</p>
<p>
“Then you must be a Pennsylvania Dutchman.
I’ve heard of that kind before, but you’re
the first one I ever saw.”
</p>
<p>
There was a titter at this, and Flink’s dark
face flushed.
</p>
<p>
“Sam, you shouldn’t have said that,” warned
Dan. “It was not very courteous.”
</p>
<p>
“Neither is he. I don’t like him.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll lick you for that when we get outside,”
growled Flink. “You’re too fresh.”
</p>
<p>
Sam was about to make a retort when Dan
pinched him sharply.
</p>
<p>
“Keep still. You will get into trouble.”
</p>
<p>
Sam’s freckles were standing out again and
his shock of red hair seemed to be rising higher.
</p>
<p>
“He—he threatened me—he gave me a dare.
I’ll make him wish he were back in Pennsylvania,”
protested Sam belligerently.
</p>
<p>
“Take my advice and do nothing of the sort.
You forget that everything we do now will count
for or against us. It won’t do to start in on our
career with bad conduct marks against us.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t care; I——”
</p>
<p>
Dan’s hand closed firmly over the arm of his
companion. Sam twisted angrily, but gradually
he regained control of himself. He did not look
toward the scowling face of Flink, not daring to
trust himself to do so.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>
</p>
<p>
Dan’s grip relaxed. The two lads bent over
their plates and resumed their interrupted meal.
</p>
<p>
“Look out!” sang out a voice.
</p>
<p>
Dan’s head was inclined slightly toward that
of his companion, he being about to make some
remark to Sam. Both lads glanced up quickly
their ears caught the warning.
</p>
<p>
“Duck it!” came the second warning. But
the warning was too late.
</p>
<p>
Smack!
</p>
<p>
Something hit Dan Davis squarely in the face,
filling mouth, eyes and nostrils. He could not
see a thing.
</p>
<p>
Sam Hickey started to his feet with an angry
growl.
</p>
<p>
Smack!
</p>
<p>
Something smote him on the face with the
same result.
</p>
<p>
A piece of pie had been hurled at Sam, but
the first piece had missed him, Dan catching the
full force of it. The second shot had been delivered
with better aim, and Sam that time got
the pie that was intended for him.
</p>
<p>
“Who did that?” demanded Dan, wiping the
sticky stuff from his eyes and glaring about.
</p>
<p>
About that time Sam had succeeded in freeing
his own eyes. His face was pale and the
patches of freckles stood out in bold relief.
</p>
<p>
“You threw that pie, Flink.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes; he threw the pie,” answered a chorus
of voices.
</p>
<p>
“Never mind; you need not tell me about it,
fellows. I’ll take care of Mr. Flink. I’ll hand
him back as good as he sent, and it will not be
pie either.”
</p>
<p>
Sam, whom Dan had pulled back into his chair,
started to rise again.
</p>
<p>
“Look out! Here comes an officer,” warned
a boy sitting on the other side of him.
</p>
<p>
Sam sank back into his chair and began mopping
the remnants of the pie from his face,
while Dan was doing the same for himself.
</p>
<p>
“Not a word,” whispered Dan warningly.
</p>
<p>
The quartermaster was standing in the doorway,
eyeing the group of rookies sternly.
</p>
<p>
“What is the meaning of this?” he demanded.
</p>
<p>
No one answered. All hands bent over their
plates.
</p>
<p>
“Attention!”
</p>
<p>
The lads, after an instant’s hesitation, straggled
to their feet. That is, all did save Sam
Hickey. Sam coolly helped himself to another
chunk of hot corn bread, which he proceeded to
eat.
</p>
<p>
“Attention!”
</p>
<p>
The eyes of the quartermaster were fixed upon
him, but Sam did not move.
</p>
<p>
The officer walked over and touched the lad
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>
on the shoulder. Sam looked up in well-feigned
surprise.
</p>
<p>
“Did you not hear my command?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, talking to me, were you?” questioned the
boy innocently.
</p>
<p>
“Do you understand the meaning of ‘Attention’?”
</p>
<p>
“I suppose it means to pay attention.”
</p>
<p>
“It means that you are to come to attention.
If you are sitting, when the command is given,
you are to rise instantly and come to attention.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir.”
</p>
<p>
There was a broad grin on the faces of all
the apprentices, save that of the dark-faced
Louis Flink. His head was slouched forward
and he was peering up at the officer, a resentful
scowl on his face.
</p>
<p>
“Attention!”
</p>
<p>
This time Sam Hickey got to his feet, wiped
his face and mouth with his handkerchief, and
slowly came to attention.
</p>
<p>
“Next time you will be put on extra duty,”
announced the officer. “I will excuse you this
time, as you do not understand the regulations
thoroughly. Now what has been going on
here?”
</p>
<p>
There was silence in the mess hall.
</p>
<p>
“Something has been thrown—some one has
been throwing food. I see remnants of it on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span>
floor there,” the officer added, pointing accusingly.
</p>
<p>
Sam turned, looking at the spot indicated as if
in surprise.
</p>
<p>
“Attention! Keep your eyes to the front. If
I am not——”
</p>
<p>
“It was pie,” piped a voice at the lower end
of the table.
</p>
<p>
“Pie?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Some one threw it?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“At whom?”
</p>
<p>
The lad, a very young recruit, pointed to Sam
and Dan. There were traces of pie on Dan’s
cheeks still.
</p>
<p>
Dan had given the young recruit a warning
glance, whereat the lad checked himself and volunteered
no further information.
</p>
<p>
“Davis, is this true?” demanded the quartermaster
sternly.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“One of these men threw a piece of pie at
you?”
</p>
<p>
“A piece of pie hit me in the face. There
were two pieces thrown.”
</p>
<p>
“Both at you?”
</p>
<p>
“I think not.”
</p>
<p>
“At whom, then?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>
</p>
<p>
“One struck me in the face and the other hit
my friend Sam, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“You know who threw the pie?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Name him.”
</p>
<p>
Dan was silent.
</p>
<p>
“Point out the man who did it.”
</p>
<p>
“Sir, I would rather not,” answered Dan,
eyeing the officer steadily, but with nothing of
disrespect in his gaze.
</p>
<p>
“I repeat, point out the man.”
</p>
<p>
“Sir, I have no wish to inform on one of my
shipmates. I wish you would not press the question,
sir. I wish to obey orders strictly, but I
cannot be a sneak. Perhaps the pie was thrown
in a spirit of fun. I am sure the man who threw
it is sorry for his act now, and then there was no
harm done, except that my uniform is slightly
soiled.”
</p>
<p>
The quartermaster turned to Sam Hickey.
For a moment he eyed the freckled-faced boy
steadily. Sam did not quail. He returned the
quartermaster’s gaze steadily.
</p>
<p>
“You were hit also?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“With the same piece?”
</p>
<p>
“No, sir; with a second piece.”
</p>
<p>
“Then the first one must have been intended
for you,” decided the officer shrewdly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>
</p>
<p>
“I think it was, sir, but it was not a good shot.
I could beat that myself.”
</p>
<p>
“Silence!”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“And you know who threw the pie?”
</p>
<p>
“I could guess, though I didn’t see much of
anything when the pie hit me. I got a mouthful,
too.”
</p>
<p>
“Who threw it?”
</p>
<p>
Sam hesitated, shifted his weight from one
foot to the other, twisting about as if seeking
some means of escape from his present position.
</p>
<p>
“I can’t tell you, sir,” he said in a low, determined
voice.
</p>
<p>
“You mean you will not?”
</p>
<p>
“I mean, sir, that I would rather not. If you
will excuse me I’ll take care of the fellow who
struck me with the apple pie, all in good time.
He won’t use my face for a target another time,
after I get through with him.”
</p>
<p>
The apprentices, forgetful of discipline, burst
out into a roar of laughter.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span><a name='chIV' id='chIV'></a>CHAPTER IV—PIPING UP HAMMOCKS</h2>
<p>
The quartermaster eyed the two boys
sternly for a moment. He did not ask
any of the other men who had thrown
the pie.
</p>
<p>
“Carry on!” he commanded, the suspicion of
a smile playing about the corners of his mouth.
But he hid the smile from them by passing a
hand over his mouth.
</p>
<p>
No one moved in obedience to his command.
</p>
<p>
“When I say ‘Carry on,’ it means that you
are to resume whatever you were doing at the
time attention was commanded. In this instance
you were at your breakfasts. Continue it.
Carry on!”
</p>
<p>
The boys sat down to finish their breakfasts
which now proceeded without further interruption.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve changed my mind,” Sam informed his
companion in a low tone.
</p>
<p>
“How so?”
</p>
<p>
“I am going to quit.”
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t want to be a jackie.”
</p>
<p>
“You already are one—that is you are a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>
rookie, which is practically the same thing. We
shall be jackies in twelve weeks if we have good
luck.”
</p>
<p>
“I won’t. I won’t be here then.”
</p>
<p>
“Where will you be?”
</p>
<p>
“Back in Piedmont.”
</p>
<p>
“Look here, Sam Hickey, what do you propose
to do?” demanded Dan.
</p>
<p>
“Go home; that’s what I propose to do.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you know what would happen to you
were you to do a thing like that?”
</p>
<p>
“Nothing very much, I guess.”
</p>
<p>
“Were you to leave now, you would be a deserter.
You would be arrested and sent to
prison. And that is not all.”
</p>
<p>
“Go on; what else?”
</p>
<p>
“You would be disgraced for life. Why do
you even think of doing a thing like that?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I reckoned I’d like to lick that Pennsylvania
Dutchman and then go back home.
They’d probably make a fuss about it here, if
I give him what he deserves,” replied Sam
slowly.
</p>
<p>
“I should say they would. Forget it. Do
your duty. Have too much respect for the Flag
under which you are serving, to disgrace it by
doing any such foolish thing as you propose.
There goes a bugle. It must be some sort of
command for us.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>
</p>
<p>
It was.
</p>
<p>
“Attention!” commanded the officer.
</p>
<p>
The men rose from their seats.
</p>
<p>
“Those whose names I call will fall in with
bags and equipment and march to barracks A.”
</p>
<p>
He then called off the names of the apprentices
who were to leave the detention barracks,
Sam and Dan’s names being among them. This
done, the boys gathered their bags and falling
into line started off across the grounds, led by
the officer.
</p>
<p>
Barracks A was to be their quarters for the
next three weeks. Here, they were turned over
to another quartermaster, who proceeded to instruct
them in their duties.
</p>
<p>
To each man he assigned a billet, that is a
place where he should sling his hammock each
night before he turned in, for the lads were to
live just as they would when aboard ship.
</p>
<p>
The hammocks were made of canvas, and
were suspended from hooks in the ceiling, so
high up that a person could walk under the hammocks
by stooping slightly.
</p>
<p>
“Each of you,” said the instructor, “will be
expected to sling his hammock every night and
lash it in the morning. If you will observe me
I will show you how it is done.”
</p>
<p>
The apprentices gathered about.
</p>
<p>
“You first hook the ring of the clews to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>
hammock hook; then pass each outer nettle from
out inwards through the eyelet on its own side
of the hammock. Square the two nettles and
take a half hitch with each. Pass the remaining
nettles in the same manner, extending the end
of each through the hitch, following it toward
the center. Sling the other end in the same
manner. Is that clear?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I think so,” answered Dan rather
doubtfully.
</p>
<p>
“How about you, Hickey?”
</p>
<p>
“Maybe I could do it, now that I’ve seen you
go through the motions, sir, but I couldn’t tell
a fellow how to do it to save my life.”
</p>
<p>
The apprentices grinned broadly.
</p>
<p>
“Attention! Now, in the morning, to lash
the hammocks, you place the mattress squarely
in it, fold the blanket, placing it in lengthwise
and roll it up taut. Lash with seven marline
turns. Turn the hammock over several times to
twist the clews, unhook one end at a time and
tuck the clews under the lashing and haul them
taut. When the reveille is sounded hammocks
must be stowed within fifteen minutes. Is that
clear, Hickey?”
</p>
<p>
“Clear as mud—sir,” added Sam, flushing
hotly as he realized a moment later that he had
said something that might bring a rebuke upon
him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>
</p>
<p>
It did. The quartermaster read him a stern
lecture on the necessity for speaking in a respectful
manner at all times. Sam was told that
a direct question called for a direct answer,
“without any trimmings.”
</p>
<p>
“I seem to be getting all that’s coming to me,”
whispered the boy to his companion.
</p>
<p>
“You talk too much; that’s your worst fault,
and the one that is likely to get you into trouble
if you don’t look out.”
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t talk when the other officer was trying
to make me tell who smashed me with the
pie, did I?”
</p>
<p>
“No; you showed yourself to be a man in that
case, Sam. Sh-h-h! He’s speaking to you.”
</p>
<p>
“Sir?”
</p>
<p>
“You will now try the hammock.”
</p>
<p>
“How do you mean, sir?” questioned Sam.
</p>
<p>
“Get in it.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir; where’s the ladder?”
</p>
<p>
“Ladder?” exploded the quartermaster.
</p>
<p>
“Sure! You don’t think I can get into that
thing without using a ladder, do you?”
</p>
<p>
“We do not use ladders. Watch carefully.
I will show you how it is done. This is the way
you will have to turn in all the time that you are
in the Navy.”
</p>
<p>
The officer reached up, grasping the rope that
held the hammock to the hooks above. With an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>
ease born of long experience he lifted himself
clear of the floor, curled his body upward and
placed himself on his back in the hammock without
the least apparent effort. The officer got
out of the hammock by a reverse movement and
with the same ease.
</p>
<p>
“Did you see how it was done?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir?”
</p>
<p>
“Think you can get in now?”
</p>
<p>
“I can make a bluff at it—sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ sir.”
</p>
<p>
“No, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Try it.”
</p>
<p>
Sam took hold of the rope as he had seen his
instructor do, glanced up at the spot where he
was expected to place himself, then set his teeth
tightly together. He sought to draw himself up
slowly, after the manner that he had been shown,
but somehow, strong as he was, his feet refused
to leave the floor.
</p>
<p>
Sam let go, wiping the perspiration from his
brow, and gripped the rope again. This time
he made a leap. His head hit the ceiling and he
sat down on the floor heavily.
</p>
<p>
“Ouch!” howled Sam, bringing a laugh from
his companions and a smile to the face of the
instructor.
</p>
<p>
“Attention! You will get the knack after a
little. Did you hurt your head?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>
</p>
<p>
“No—sir,” answered Sam, “but I think I
made a dent in the roof.”
</p>
<p>
“Carry on again.”
</p>
<p>
The apprentice gripped the rope rather more
cautiously this time, measured his distance, and
with head well inclined forward, so that he might
not hit the ceiling again, he gave a mighty leap.
</p>
<p>
Sam did not stop when he reached the hammock,
however. He kept right on. The hammock
turned over, spilling the bedding and
mattress out. But this was not all that had happened.
Hickey had lost his grip on the rope.
The result was that he struck the floor on the
other side, flat on his back.
</p>
<p>
The floor was of cement, and the shock of the
fall was severe. Sam managed to save his head,
however, and sat up rubbing himself, red of face
and thoroughly disgusted.
</p>
<p>
“Clumsy!” complained the officer.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir; but you see I’ve never had to go to
bed that way before.”
</p>
<p>
“Try it again.”
</p>
<p>
“If it’s all the same to you, sir, I think I
should prefer to sleep on the floor.”
</p>
<p>
This reply brought another sharp reprimand
from the officer. But their instruction in slinging
hammocks was over and they turned to other
matters.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span><a name='chV' id='chV'></a>CHAPTER V—TRYING OUT THEIR GRIT</h2>
<p>
Sam’s billet was next to that of Louis
Flink. The former was not aware of
this until that night, when the lads
turned in at the sound of the bugle. So close
were their hammocks that either boy might have
reached out and touched the other. Sam had
turned in after several disastrous attempts and
much quiet grumbling. Dan caught the knack
of it more quickly, and so did Flink.
</p>
<p>
“Say, freckles, you’re a thickhead,” jeered
Flink.
</p>
<p>
“I’d rather be a thickhead than a Pennsylvania
Dutchman, any day,” retorted the freckle-faced
boy. “There’s some hope for a thickhead,
but there isn’t any for you.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll settle with you some other time,” sneered
Flink. Both were speaking in low tones, knowing
that they would get at least a rebuke, were
any of the officers to overhear them.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, that’s your measure all right. I didn’t
give you away this morning. Neither did my
friend, but it wasn’t because we loved you. No,
Blinkers, it was because we wanted to wait for
the proper moment to give you the worst thrashing you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>
ever had in your life. Don’t bother me
now; I want to go to sleep.”
</p>
<p>
The first night of their stay at the training
station passed uneventfully. At the sound of
the bugle, on the following morning, all hands
started up suddenly. Sam Hickey muttered
drowsily and turned over.
</p>
<p>
“Get up, thickhead!” jeered Flink, giving
the lad a vicious dig with his fist.
</p>
<p>
“Wha—wha——” demanded Sam sleepily.
</p>
<p>
“Turn out, old chap,” called Dan. “Didn’t
you hear the bugle?”
</p>
<p>
Sam suddenly bethought himself of his duty,
but he did not give thought to the fact that he
was in a hammock. He thought he was in bed.
Without opening his eyes he started to get out
in the usual way.
</p>
<p>
The result was inevitable. Sam once more
flattened himself upon the hard cement floor
underneath his billet. He was awake without
further urging.
</p>
<p>
“Say, Dan, how long did we enlist for?” he
demanded.
</p>
<p>
“Four years.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, help!” moaned Sam, pulling himself together
and starting for the shower bath with
his clothes under his arm. At the door of the
bathroom he paused long enough to shake his
fist at Flink.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>
</p>
<p>
“Blinkers, I remember now, something hit me
this morning before I got my eyes open. Much
obliged. That’s another score you’ll have to answer
for when the day of reckoning comes
around.”
</p>
<p>
Flink grinned sarcastically, as he climbed
down from his hammock and prepared to follow
to the bathroom.
</p>
<p>
Breakfast that morning was more interesting.
There were all of fifty boys in the mess of barracks
A, all of whom marched across the grounds
to the mess hall, the newcomers bringing up the
rear in a straggling line.
</p>
<p>
“I guess we are not making much of a showing,”
grinned Dan. “Our fire company at home
could beat the alignment of this bunch. But
see how those boys up ahead are marching.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes; nobody would think they were going to
breakfast,” replied Sam, with a hand slyly laid
upon his stomach. “I have a goneness here that
nothing except a hot breakfast will satisfy.”
</p>
<p>
Practically the first duty of the day was drill.
The apprentices were instructed in the rudiments
of company drill. Led by a drum and
bugle corps, they marched back and forth across
the field in the sunlight, with the sparkling waters
of the bay almost at their feet. Dan Davis
had had some experience in drilling, and he
proved himself an apt pupil.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span>
</p>
<p>
After the drill the boys were marched to the
drill hall, where they were given guns and instructed
in the manual of arms.
</p>
<p>
“This is something like,” grinned Sam, who
was thoroughly at home with a gun in his hand.
“I’d like to take this piece out and hunt woodchucks
with it. I’ll bet it’s a dandy for
chucks.”
</p>
<p>
“Wouldn’t it be likely to blow them off the
face of the earth?” questioned Dan, with a smile.
</p>
<p>
“It might that.”
</p>
<p>
“Attention!” commanded the officer, who had
caught the faint sound of voices. “No talking
in the ranks.”
</p>
<p>
The lads subsided instantly.
</p>
<p>
“We will now have a little physical drill, and
after that a cock-fight,” announced the officer.
</p>
<p>
Dan and Sam glanced at each other in surprise.
</p>
<p>
“Going to have a rooster fight?” whispered
Sam. “They’re real sports up here, after all.”
</p>
<p>
“Sh-h-h,” warned Dan. “I think it must be
something else. They wouldn’t have rooster
fights here.”
</p>
<p>
The officer was explaining to them the various
movements in the physical drill, calculated
to give the boys a powerful physique as well as
great suppleness. He described the movements
as “full sweeps,” “body circles” and “side
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>
stoop,” which latter Sam characterized as the
back porch movement. These, after being executed,
were followed by a hurdle race.
</p>
<p>
When the announcement was made that this
would be next on the program the boys could
scarcely repress a cheer. But the hurdle race
was not to be the harum-scarum, go-as-you-please
contest that they had been in the habit
of playing. Instead, it was an orderly, systematic
race in which the line formation was supposed
to be kept throughout.
</p>
<p>
However, the lads went at it with a will. The
variety of the work kept them constantly interested.
There was not a dull or tiresome moment
in all that morning’s work, the instructor leading
them from one thing to another until the
faces of the apprentices glowed and their eyes
sparkled with excitement and pleasure.
</p>
<p>
“Halt!”
</p>
<p>
The movements had come to an end for the
day.
</p>
<p>
“Next will be a cock-fight. You young apprentices
may not understand the game, so we
will let the older men go through a brief battle
while you look on.”
</p>
<p>
The plan of the game was for the boys to
form in two lines some ten paces apart and
at the command “hop,” they were to hop
forward on the left or right foot as the case
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>
might be and attempt to bowl their adversaries
over.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve played that game,” whispered Sam.
“Let me get into it and I’ll show them a cock-fight
that will make the fellows green with
envy.”
</p>
<p>
“Fall in, apprentices!” came the command.
</p>
<p>
The lads obeyed with alacrity.
</p>
<p>
“Do you see the Pennsylvania Dutchman over
there on the other side?” whispered Sam.
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“Well you watch Pennsy. I’m going to
pluck that rooster’s tail feathers, or my name
isn’t Sam Hickey.”
</p>
<p>
“Be careful that you do not do anything that
will bring a reproof. You will get a mark
against you, if you do.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you worry. The marks will be on
Blinkers, not on me.”
</p>
<p>
“Attention!”
</p>
<p>
The boys straightened. There was a grin on
the face of Sam Hickey, and had one been an
observer, he would have noticed another on the
face of Louis Flink.
</p>
<p>
“Right foot, hop!”
</p>
<p>
Fifty apprentices began hopping across the
floor, some losing their balance and measuring
their length upon the drill floor at the first jump.
</p>
<p>
Sam did not appear to be noticing the adversary he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>
had picked out. Neither did Flink seem
to have Sam in mind. However, all at once both
boys made a sudden turn. They lunged toward
each other like two human projectiles.
</p>
<p>
The impact of their bodies when they came together,
was heard all over the drill room and the
lads bounded back, hopping in a circle, for several
seconds, to catch their balance.
</p>
<p>
Once more they came together, followed by a
rebound of greater force than before.
</p>
<p>
“Too much for you, eh?” laughed Dan, as
he hopped by his companion.
</p>
<p>
“He’s tougher than I thought, but I can stay
on my feet as long as he can, though my hopper
weighs a ton at this minute.”
</p>
<p>
The men were falling out rapidly now, here
and there one toppling over, another touching
the floor with his free foot or grasping a pillar
for support. All such were ruled out of the
game.
</p>
<p>
After five minutes the battle had narrowed
down to Sam Hickey and Louis Flink.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve got you now, Blinkers,” announced
Sam, with a grin.
</p>
<p>
“No talking,” commanded the officer.
“Hands at sides and keep fighting until one of
you is down.”
</p>
<p>
“Look out, I’m coming,” warned Flink in a
low tone.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>
</p>
<p>
“Thank you; so am I,” returned Sam.
</p>
<p>
Neither boy swerved, but, as they neared each
other, they turned so that their shoulders met,
sending them far apart again. By this time, the
officers and assembled apprentices had become
deeply interested. They realized that this cock-fight
was different from anything they ever had
seen. Two gladiators of the pit were before
them, and, providing there was no interference
from the officers, there was excitement ahead.
</p>
<p>
The petty officers in charge so far lost themselves
in the unusual battle as to overlook the
fact that the apprentices were not only talking,
but urging on the contestants and giving them
suggestions.
</p>
<p>
It was noticeable, however, that the sympathy
of the crowd was with the red-headed, freckle-faced
boy, Sam Hickey. Sam’s face wore a
broad grin. No matter how hard a rap he might
get the grin remained. If he was the least bit
angry he kept the fact well hidden.
</p>
<p>
Flink, on the other hand, was getting more
and more angry as the minutes passed. He had
reckoned on making short work of his opponent,
but found that the raw-boned country boy was
as hard as nails, and not to be downed except
by superior strength, nor to be frightened by a
bluff.
</p>
<p>
Back and forth the two boys hopped, smashing together,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>
bounding apart, dancing about each
other in circles, sparring for an opening as it
were. Thus far each had proved himself too
wary for the other.
</p>
<p>
Hickey, either through design or accident, had
been crowding his opponent toward the broad
doorway on the west side of the drill room. But,
if there was a motive in the action, no one appeared
to understand it. Now, Sam was hopping
about his adversary so rapidly that Flink
was forced to keep spinning until he was giving
a very good imitation of a top. So ludicrous
were his movements that the apprentices
shouted with laughter. At the same time Sam
was darting in and out, but not landing on Flink
at all. His sole purpose now appeared to be to
confuse the other man.
</p>
<p>
Flink was growing weary. The onlookers noticed
that his movements were becoming slower
and slower. Sam had observed this already,
and his eyes lighted triumphantly.
</p>
<p>
The dark-faced apprentice had spun himself
about until he was just opposite the open doorway,
a few paces from it, when Hickey uttered
a loud grunt and hurled himself upon his opponent.
</p>
<p>
At that moment, Flink’s back chanced to be
toward Hickey. Sam landed in the small of the
other’s back with irresistible force.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>
</p>
<p>
Flink shot toward the door, the apprentices
setting up a howl, followed by a cheer. But
their merriment died on their lips. Lieutenant
Commander Devall, the executive officer of the
station, attracted by the noise in the drill hall,
had hurried down the walk to ascertain the cause
of the disturbance. His trim, white-clad figure
appeared in the doorway, just as Louis Flink
was making his flight.
</p>
<p>
Flink hit the executive officer with great violence,
the two landing on the cement walk outside,
with the apprentice on top.
</p>
<p>
Beyond the narrow walk was a steep bank
leading down almost to the water’s edge. On
over the bank rolled the apprentice and the lieutenant
commander, each making desperate efforts
to save himself.
</p>
<p>
It was a most undignified position for a lieutenant
commander to find himself in, to say
nothing of the unpleasantness of going over a
bank with a raw apprentice on top of one.
</p>
<p>
“They’re over!” shouted a voice.
</p>
<p>
Dan sprang forward to the quartermaster,
saluting.
</p>
<p>
“May I go over and help them, sir?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. Make haste.”
</p>
<p>
Dan sprang out through the doorway and
down the bank.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span><a name='chVI' id='chVI'></a>CHAPTER VI—IN THE MIDST OF THE BATTLE</h2>
<p>
“A nice mix-up. There’ll be an awful
row about this,” muttered Dan, as he
slid down the steep bank on his feet.
</p>
<p>
When he reached the bottom, Flink, the apprentice,
still bore the greater part of his weight
upon the officer.
</p>
<p>
“Here’s my chance,” decided Dan. Springing
to his feet, he grabbed Flink by the collar
with both hands. Giving him a violent tug,
Flink came away, Dan hurling him to one side
with surprising strength.
</p>
<p>
“May I help you, sir?” he asked courteously.
</p>
<p>
The officer did not answer, but there was an
angry gleam in his eyes.
</p>
<p>
Dan proceeded to brush him off, using the
sleeves of his own jacket for the purpose, while
the officer stood still until the brushing was finished.
He then stepped back and saluted.
</p>
<p>
“Thank you, my lad. Are you the one who is
responsible for this?”
</p>
<p>
“No, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Who is?”
</p>
<p>
“The men were holding a cock-fight under orders,
sir.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>
</p>
<p>
“Ah, I see. Who is that apprentice?”
</p>
<p>
“I believe his name is Flink, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Who threw him out?”
</p>
<p>
“My friend, Hickey, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Very well; you may go.”
</p>
<p>
Dan made his way around the base of the embankment,
and a few moments later joined his
companions in the drill hall, where he saluted
his superior, fell in and began his practice work
once more.
</p>
<p>
Sam’s face was as solemn as he could make
it. Flink, on the contrary, when he rejoined the
squad, was scowling angrily. He was dust-covered,
his face smeared and altogether he presented
a most ludicrous sight.
</p>
<p>
They were once more being put through the
manual of arms when a messenger approached
the quartermaster. A brief conversation ensued.
</p>
<p>
The quartermaster ran his eyes down the line.
</p>
<p>
“Hickey, fall out!” he commanded.
</p>
<p>
The red-haired boy did so.
</p>
<p>
“Do not lose your temper. You are going to
be called down. Be respectful and use your
head,” warned Dan in a whisper, as Sam
stepped back from the line.
</p>
<p>
“Report to the executive officer in the chief
yeoman’s office on the balcony above,” commanded
the quartermaster.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>
</p>
<p>
“Aye, aye, sir,” replied Sam, with a salute.
</p>
<p>
He made his way up the stairs, and at the
door of the office gave the orderly his name.
After a moment the orderly reappeared, motioning
Sam to follow him.
</p>
<p>
The lad walked into the private office of the
executive officer, where he stood twisting his hat
in his hands awkwardly. The executive officer
eyed him disapprovingly.
</p>
<p>
“What’s your name?”
</p>
<p>
“Samuel Hickey, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“How long have you been here?”
</p>
<p>
“One day, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“You are the man who threw the man Flink
against me, are you not?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir,” answered Sam, making a great
effort to suppress the grin that curled the corners
of his mouth.
</p>
<p>
“Tell me how it happened?”
</p>
<p>
“We were having a cock-fight, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes; go on.”
</p>
<p>
“They were all down except the fellow Flink
and myself. We were fighting it out. He was
a pretty tough proposition, and I had a hard
time of it.”
</p>
<p>
“You employed no unnecessary roughness?”
</p>
<p>
“I was not very gentle about it, sir,” answered
Sam truthfully. “I was trying to bump
him over.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>
</p>
<p>
“And you did not care particularly how hard
you hit him?”
</p>
<p>
“I hit him as hard as I could every time,
sir.”
</p>
<p>
“There is bad blood between you and this
man, is there not?”
</p>
<p>
Sam looked surprised. He was not aware
that the executive officer knew anything about
that.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t like him, sir, if that is what you
mean.”
</p>
<p>
“Why not?”
</p>
<p>
“I would rather not say, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Has he done anything to you?”
</p>
<p>
“I can’t say, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“You mean you will not?”
</p>
<p>
“I would rather not, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Young man, you are new here, else I should
be inclined to treat you with great severity. I
am satisfied that you threw the man Flink out
of the drill hall with malicious intent. That, of
itself, is sufficient to merit calling you before the
mast for examination and sentence. I do not
wish to do that, in view of the fact that you do
not fully understand the ways of the school.
But discipline must be maintained. I will see
to it that no marks are laid against you in this
instance. However, as soon as you have finished
your routine, you will take an extra duty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>
tour of two hours, carrying a rifle. You will so
report to your commanding officer.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir,” answered Sam meekly. “What
do I do with the gun?”
</p>
<p>
“Carry it. You will receive your instructions
from the quartermaster. Return to your company.”
</p>
<p>
Sam saluted and walked back to the drill hall.
He did not feel particularly humiliated, well
knowing that, while he was to blame in a way,
the other fellow was more so.
</p>
<p>
“What happened?” whispered Dan as Sam
fell into line once more.
</p>
<p>
“I got mine.”
</p>
<p>
“Punishment?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“What kind?”
</p>
<p>
“Extra duty tour—with a gun. I’m glad he
told me to carry a gun. I can amuse myself
with the gun. I wish he had told me to load it
and go woodchuck hunting.”
</p>
<p>
Dan looked a bit troubled, but Sam took his
punishment good-naturedly.
</p>
<p>
An hour later, found him tramping up and
down the drill ground in the hot sun, with a rifle
slung over his shoulders. He had not been there
long before he saw Louis Flink approaching him,
the latter having been sent to quarters on some
mission or other.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>
</p>
<p>
Sam pretended not to see him until Flink
halted before him with a stealthy glance to the
rear to make sure that he was not observed.
</p>
<p>
“Hullo, red-head. Got what’s coming to you,
didn’t you!” sneered Flink.
</p>
<p>
“That’s where you’ve got the best of me
Blinkers. You haven’t got what is coming to
you yet, so you have something to look forward
to. Go on about your business before I put
down this gun and thrash you. Go on!”
</p>
<p>
Sam made a move toward his tormentor,
whereat Flink made haste to get out of the way.
From a safe distance he taunted Sam until he
saw a blue-coated figure approaching. Flink
hurried on about his business, Sam taking up
his steady march.
</p>
<p>
The figure, which proved to be that of a lieutenant
whom Sam had not seen before, came on,
but the boy did not appear to see him. He was
too busy marching apparently, to heed even an
officer. But Sam was suddenly called to his
duty by a sharp command.
</p>
<p>
“Halt!”
</p>
<p>
Instinctively the lad stiffened.
</p>
<p>
“Attention! Young man, do you not understand
what ‘attention’ means?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Then what is that gun doing on your
shoulder?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>
</p>
<p>
“I—I don’t know, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you know that you should come to
present arms when an officer passes?”
</p>
<p>
“No, sir. No one ever told me that before.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you study your Handy Books?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir, but I have been here only a day.”
</p>
<p>
“Present arms!”
</p>
<p>
Sam came to a present.
</p>
<p>
“Carry on!” came the sharp command, after
which Hickey again shouldered his weapon and
began his measured pacing back and forth. The
lieutenant passed on, Sam gazing after him with
a scowl upon his face.
</p>
<p>
“I hope to get to be an officer some of these
days. Won’t I make the rest of the bunch step
around lively? I don’t seem to be able to do
anything to suit anybody.”
</p>
<p>
For the next two hours the lad continued his
extra duty tour, this time, however, keeping a
sharp lookout for approaching officers. No
officers showed themselves in his vicinity. Now
and then a group of apprentices would pass with
the invariable greeting, “Hullo, red-head!”
</p>
<p>
To this Sam made no response. He was determined
to take his medicine and show himself
to be a man, even if he was being punished.
</p>
<p>
At last the sky became overcast. Dark clouds
began sweeping in from the sea, swirling and
tumbling riotously.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span>
</p>
<p>
“It looks like rain,” decided the red-headed
boy, halting long enough to gaze anxiously seaward.
“I wonder whether they are going to
keep me here all the rest of the day?”
</p>
<p>
The storm broke with a suddenness that he
had never before observed, for Hickey never
had had any experience with coast storms. The
lightning seemed to be everywhere, followed by
peals of thunder and deafening crashes, as if
the coast artillery were at work the whole length
of the Atlantic seaboard.
</p>
<p>
“It looks like rain,” reiterated the apprentice,
shifting his rifle to the other shoulder. “I
shouldn’t be surprised if that bolt struck somewhere.
I should feel badly if it were to hit
Blinkers, for I want to get a crack at him myself.
I guess——”
</p>
<p>
Sam Hickey did not finish what he was about
to say. A blinding flash reflected the buildings
of the station in the dark waters of the bay.
When the thunder had died away in a rumbling
echo Sam was not in sight. He lay in a little
depression of ground, half immersed in a puddle
of water.
</p>
<p>
How long he lay there he did not know, but
gradually he began to realize that he was very
wet. He tried to open his eyes, but the rain
dashing into them almost blinded him.
</p>
<p>
“I must be drowned,” he decided; then he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>
resolutely pulled himself together, struggled to
his feet and began hunting about for his rifle.
That weapon, when finally he found it, was a
sorry-looking object.
</p>
<p>
“Well, well, I wonder what happened,” muttered
Sam. “I know—the thing has been struck
by lightning.”
</p>
<p>
The barrel of the rifle, he found, was twisted
out of shape, the stock was hanging in splinters,
while some parts of the weapon had entirely
disappeared.
</p>
<p>
Sam viewed the wreck ruefully.
</p>
<p>
“I expect I’ll get about ten years in the brig
when they see that,” he wailed. “They’ll have
me in jail for life, first thing I know. Who’d
ever think a streak of lightning could cut up
such pranks as these? I remember, now, the
thing did feel awfully hot before I went to
sleep.”
</p>
<p>
Sam considered for a moment, gazed longingly
off to the roof of barracks A, faintly visible
above a rise of ground. Then, shouldering
his ruined rifle, he began plodding up and down
again, the rain beating on him in blinding,
drenching sheets.
</p>
<p>
Every little while, he would glance hopefully
toward the barracks, where he knew all hands
were snug and dry in their white suits, perhaps
having a good time. His discontent was added
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>
to when he heard the bugle blow for the midday
mess.
</p>
<p>
“There, I’ll lose my dinner,” complained
Hickey. “I knew something serious would happen
before the day was over. I wonder if they
have forgotten me?”
</p>
<p>
“They” had. But now the roll was being
called as the apprentices formed for the mess.
About that time the sun came out, and Sam
discovered an officer in a rain coat rapidly approaching
him. It was Lieutenant Commander
Devall. The officer had his eye on the boy long
before reaching him.
</p>
<p>
“What does this mean?” he demanded, gazing
with surprise at the mud-covered, torn
uniform and the twisted, ruined rifle on the
shoulder of the plodding figure of Sam Hickey.
</p>
<p>
“My rifle was struck by lightning, sir,” answered
the lad, coming to a present arms.
</p>
<h2><a name='chVII' id='chVII'></a>CHAPTER VII—THE RED-HEADED BOY’S SURPRISE</h2>
<p>
“I should say it had!” exclaimed the
amazed officer. “Let me see the rifle.”
</p>
<p>
He examined the weapon critically,
Sam standing at attention, expecting every moment
to be severely rebuked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>
</p>
<p>
“When did this happen?”
</p>
<p>
“About an hour ago, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“You were hurt?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know. I was laid out. I guess I
would have drowned if I hadn’t come to when
I did,” answered the lad, forgetting to add the
“sir.” The lieutenant commander appeared
not to observe the slip.
</p>
<p>
“You regained consciousness, and have been
on your extra duty tour ever since?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Come with me.”
</p>
<p>
Sam wonderingly followed his superior officer
to barracks A. The officer led the way right
into the mess hall. Looks of surprise greeted
the appearance of the couple, which soon gave
place to broad grins, for Sam Hickey at that
moment was the most disreputable figure possible
to imagine.
</p>
<p>
“Attention!” called the petty officer in charge
of the mess when he saw the lieutenant commander
entering.
</p>
<p>
Dan saw at once that something had happened,
yet he could not understand it at all, unless
Sam had been in a fight. That was the first
thing that occurred to Davis.
</p>
<p>
All hands had risen to their feet, and had
come to attention at command.
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Coda,” said the lieutenant commander
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>
sharply, “you assigned this man to extra duty,
did you not?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir,” answered the quartermaster.
“Acting on your command, as delivered to me
by the man himself.”
</p>
<p>
“Exactly. How long did he tell you he was
to remain on duty?”
</p>
<p>
“Two hours, sir. I was to give him his
orders when the tour of extra duty was ended,
sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you know how long he has been on
duty?”
</p>
<p>
“About four hours, I think, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Exactly,” answered the line officer dryly.
</p>
<p>
“The storm came on and I lost sight of this
man. There were three other extra duty squads
out in different parts of the grounds. These
I rounded up, but I will confess that I entirely
forgot the man Hickey, sir,” continued the
quartermaster, saluting as he spoke.
</p>
<p>
“After mess, report to my office. I have
something to say to these men now.”
</p>
<p>
“Are they to carry on, sir?”
</p>
<p>
“By no means until I direct them to do so.
What I have to say should be heard standing.”
</p>
<p>
“Very good, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Men,” began the lieutenant commander,
running his eyes over the brown faces of the
apprentices, “I am very glad to be able to give
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>
you an object lesson. I hope every man of you
will keep it in mind for the rest of his career
in the Navy.”
</p>
<p>
The officer paused, glancing at the attentive
faces before him.
</p>
<p>
“It is in reference to this young man, Hickey.
He was assigned to extra duty for a slight offense.
The offense, I am now satisfied, was
without intent to violate any rule of discipline,
and the punishment was intended more to point
a moral than otherwise. Hickey was told to
patrol his tour until relieved by the quartermaster.
Those were your orders, Mr. Quartermaster,
were they not?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Hickey walked his tour over his time. A
severe storm came up, but still he walked.
He was obeying orders. Thunder and lightning
even could not swerve him from doing that.
Then Hickey was struck down by a bolt
of lightning. You see his rifle, or what is left
of it.”
</p>
<p>
The lieutenant commander took Sam’s gun
from him, and, stepping over toward the others,
held it out for their inspection. The boys looked
at the twisted weapon, then at Sam Hickey.
Amazement was written on their faces.
</p>
<p>
“Hickey was struck as well, as that mark
on the left cheek will prove to you. He fell in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>
a puddle of water, where he lay half-drowned,
until finally he regained consciousness. I wonder
how many of you here would not have
started for cover as fast as he could run? I
hope none of you would have done so. Hickey
did not run, either. Instead, he straightened
out his broken, ruined weapon as best he could,
came to a right shoulder arms and began his
tour of duty once again. I have not the least
doubt that he would have continued all night
had he not been relieved. He was obeying
orders. As I have said before, not even lightning
could swerve him from that. Young men,
that is the kind of man the United States Navy
wants—men who will obey orders, who will
carry them out, no matter what may happen;
who will do their full duty as long as there is
a breath left in them. Quartermaster, are there
any marks against this boy?”
</p>
<p>
The petty officer consulted the records.
</p>
<p>
“No, sir. He has been here a very short time,
sir, hardly long enough to get any.”
</p>
<p>
“Very good. You will see to it that his name
is placed on record and read out in General
Orders. Hickey, you will be appointed apprentice
gunner’s mate, your promotion to take
effect immediately. It will not, however, continue
after you go aboard a ship on a regular
detail. The appointment is for the Training
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>
Station alone. It carries with it a slight increase
in pay. You have made a good beginning,
and I shall look for you to continue. Do
so, and your rise in the United States Navy will
be rapid. You are relieved from duty for the
rest of the day. Carry on, men!”
</p>
<p>
Mess being over, the quartermaster, as directed,
repaired to the office of the lieutenant
commander to receive the reprimand that he
supposed was in store for him. He was right.
The lieutenant commander was very severe
upon the quartermaster for the latter’s failure
to relieve Hickey at the proper time. The
quartermaster, in his turn, had nothing but
words of regret and apology, and was dismissed
with a word of caution for the future.
</p>
<h2><a name='chVIII' id='chVIII'></a>CHAPTER VIII—ON THE RIFLE RANGE</h2>
<p>
Sam took his seat at the mess table mechanically.
As a matter of fact he felt dazed.
He had expected a rebuke and he had
received a promotion instead.
</p>
<p>
He was aroused from his abstraction by the
voice of his chum.
</p>
<p>
“Good boy!” breathed Dan. “I am proud
of you. Fine! I knew you would show them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>
the material you are made of when you got the
chance. Were you really struck by lightning?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know. I think it must have been
the thunder clap that hit me, though I didn’t
hear it. But wasn’t that gun a sight? Nearly
tore the clothes off my back in the bargain.”
</p>
<p>
“Burn you anywhere?”
</p>
<p>
“I guess not.” Sam turned his palms up
mechanically and opened his eyes in amazement.
They had been burned by the electric fluid until
they were black to the finger tips.
</p>
<p>
“Waugh!” he exclaimed. “Good thing it
didn’t do that to my face, or I’d look just like
the Pennsylvania Dutchman.”
</p>
<p>
Sam, having his liberty, made a trip to the
town that afternoon. It was his first trip there
since arriving at the Training School. First,
however, he procured his new rating badge and,
after consulting with a petty officer, sewed it
on his sleeve. Sam strutted around for some
time after that, holding up his arm so that he
might feast his eyes on the red-lined rating
mark. He felt very proud of it, and his companion,
Dan Davis, was no less proud of him.
</p>
<p>
In the town Sam found many other apprentices
on liberty, and at their invitation he joined
them, spending the rest of the afternoon in wandering
about. They made him tell about his experiences
in being struck by lightning that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>
morning, which Sam did with more or less
relish.
</p>
<p>
“I imagine it was almost like being in a battle,
fellows,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“If you got a clip like that in battle, I reckon
you wouldn’t be bragging about it afterwards,”
suggested one.
</p>
<p>
“I’m not bragging about it,” protested
Hickey indignantly. “What’s the matter with
you? Besides, I’m an officer, now, and officers
don’t have to brag. They do things that speak
for themselves.”
</p>
<p>
“Hear him talk! He’s got a swelled head
already,” jeered one of the party. “You’ll have
a chance, to-morrow, to see whether you are any
good or not.”
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean?”
</p>
<p>
“Can you shoot?”
</p>
<p>
Sam grinned.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t make me laugh. I can shoot the
eyes out of a spud as far as I can see it.”
</p>
<p>
“What’s a spud?” piped a voice.
</p>
<p>
“You a sailor, and don’t know what a spud
is?” scoffed Sam. “A spud is a spud, otherwise
known as a potato. I am surprised at your
ignorance.”
</p>
<p>
“Louis Flink says he’s going to clean up the
whole crowd of us, to-morrow, when we get to
shooting.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>
</p>
<p>
“Shooting?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“Shooting at what?”
</p>
<p>
“Targets.”
</p>
<p>
“Are we going to do that?”
</p>
<p>
“Sure, and the ones who make the best scores
will be promoted, I understand. The officers
always do that. They are going to try out the
apprentices, to see who is good enough to
qualify for the sharpshooting record of the station.”
</p>
<p>
Hickey’s eyes glowed. As soon as possible
thereafter he excused himself. Boarding a
street car, he returned to the station.
</p>
<p>
“What do you think, Dan?” questioned Sam,
as soon as he had gotten his chum off away from
the others.
</p>
<p>
“Well, what is it? Been getting into more
trouble, young man?”
</p>
<p>
“Not I. It’s news, and you’ll say it’s real
news when you hear it.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I am listening,” smiled Dan good-naturedly.
</p>
<p>
Sam’s face was flushed with excitement, for
this had been an eventful day for him.
</p>
<p>
“Tell me all about it?”
</p>
<p>
“We are going to shoot to-morrow,” whispered
Sam in a stage whisper loud enough to
be heard a dozen yards away.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span>
</p>
<p>
“Shoot what?”
</p>
<p>
“Target work.”
</p>
<p>
“You don’t say?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” chuckled Hickey. “We won’t do a
thing to the targets, will we?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know about you, but as for myself
I never thought I was much of a marksman.
Of course, I have done some shooting, but there
are boys here who have done much more, I
guess. What’s the range?”
</p>
<p>
“I haven’t heard. But, being an officer, perhaps
I might ask some one.”
</p>
<p>
“Do not presume too much on your promotion,”
warned Dan. “You are only a very little
officer. You may lose that rating if you are
not careful.”
</p>
<p>
“Then I’ll get struck by lightning again, and
get another one,” answered Sam confidently.
</p>
<p>
That night the boys swung themselves up into
their hammocks, full of anticipation of what lay
before them on the following day. It seemed as
if they had no sooner gotten to sleep than the
bugle sounded the reveille.
</p>
<p>
They were up and at their shower baths,
laughing and chatting, a few minutes later. A
happier, more care-free lot of hardy, brown-faced
young fellows it would be difficult to find.
</p>
<p>
The early morning duties were quickly disposed
of, for the word had been passed along
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>
that they were to take their first turn at the targets
that day. Some of the boys who had never
handled a gun before were more curious than
those who had. The latter, however, were no
less anxious to be at it. When the command,
“Fall in for target practice,” was given, all
hands felt like setting up a shout of joy. They
restrained themselves, knowing full well that
such a demonstration would bring swift and sure
punishment.
</p>
<p>
After they had lined up, the officer in charge
ordered certain of the men to fall out, they being
wanted for other work. There were disappointed
ones among these, but these were told
they would be given their chance later in the
week, as very many men could not be accommodated
at one time. The target practice was to
last nearly a week, two hours a day being devoted
to it during this time.
</p>
<p>
All preparations having been made, the men
were marched to the armory where they were
equipped with their rifles and ammunition for
the day.
</p>
<p>
The apprentices were to fire five rounds
apiece, each day, only the average for the week
to count.
</p>
<p>
“Keep your nerves steady, and don’t try to
do anything fancy, just because you are an officer,”
warned Dan.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>
</p>
<p>
“You squint through your own sights; I’ll
look after mine,” retorted Sam.
</p>
<p>
Immediately after arriving at the range, the
shooting began, one man taking a shot, then giving
place to another.
</p>
<p>
Dan took his place and fired. He missed.
Sam followed, a few numbers later, and he also
missed. But when it came the turn of Louis
Flink he made a bull’s-eye the first shot. Flink
favored the two boys with a sarcastic grin as he
stepped aside to give the next man a chance.
</p>
<p>
The Battleship Boys had adjusted their sights
in the meantime, and with their next shots they,
too, each made a bull’s-eye. When the five
rounds had been fired it was found that Flink
was one point ahead of them.
</p>
<p>
The lads were disgusted with themselves. On
the following day the score was the same;
that is, each of the two boys made center
every time and so did Flink. Their only hope
now was that he might make a miss, but this he
evidently had no intention of doing, for he shot
with rare judgment and coolness.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve got a good notion to break him up by
saying something to him to-morrow,” Sam confided
to his companion that night.
</p>
<p>
“I should be ashamed of you, if you did,”
rebuked Dan.
</p>
<p>
“Ashamed of me? Why?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>
</p>
<p>
“Because it would be an unsportsmanlike and
a cowardly trick. If we cannot outshoot Blinkers,
as you call him, we shall take our medicine
like men. It seems he’s the better man at the
butts.”
</p>
<p>
The last day of the target practice arrived.
It was Saturday morning when the boys started
out for the shooting grounds. The targets stood
out strong and clear in the morning sunlight,
against the big mound of earth before which
they had been placed. By this time the shooting
of the three boys had aroused no little interest
among the others of the apprentices, and
even the officers began to feel more than ordinary
interest, for such shooting was not usual
among the rookies in their early days.
</p>
<p>
The range had now been extended to three
hundred yards. It was safe to predict that the
story of the week would be changed at this
range.
</p>
<p>
The firing began almost at once, the men with
lower scores competing first, it having been decided
to let the three leaders take their turns
at the butts after the others had finished.
</p>
<p>
“Keep your eyes open,” suggested Dan.
“Get your range well, for we mustn’t miss a
shot to-day.”
</p>
<p>
“We’re beaten anyway,” complained Sam.
</p>
<p>
“Stop it. You’re a fine sailor, you are. We
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>
are not beaten. We are never beaten until the
last shot has been fired, and even then we won’t
run up any white flag. See that Flag over there?”
</p>
<p>
“What flag?”
</p>
<p>
“The one on the staff—the Stars and
Stripes.”
</p>
<p>
“Sure.”
</p>
<p>
“Well just imagine you are under that, and
that those targets over against the hill are enemies
shooting at the Flag. What would you do
to them?”
</p>
<p>
“You know what I would do to them if I could—I’d
put them every one out of business.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s the talk! Well, they are enemies—our
enemies. You must put them out of business.”
</p>
<p>
“All right; I’m it. I’ll drill them in the eyes.
You watch me when I go to bat.”
</p>
<p>
The firing, which had been going on for the
past hour, suddenly ceased.
</p>
<p>
“Leaders shoot off scores,” came the command.
</p>
<p>
“It’s our turn,” nodded Dan. “Keep cool.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m as cool as the hot sun will allow me to
be, but I wish they would let me take off my
jacket. I’ll ask them.”
</p>
<p>
“No, no, no,” protested Dan.
</p>
<p>
“Flink take your place.”
</p>
<p>
The dark-faced Pennsylvanian, a confident
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>
smile on his face, took his place toeing the mark.
He took careful aim, pulled the trigger and lowered
his weapon to his waist line.
</p>
<p>
“Bull’s-eye,” wig-wagged the signal man at
the butts.
</p>
<p>
“Davis!” called the officer in charge.
</p>
<p>
Dan stepped to the mark, stood for a moment
gazing off at the range. Then, raising his gun,
he took aim and fired without loss of time. The
onlookers thought he had missed, for his shot
was apparently carelessly executed.
</p>
<p>
“Bull’s-eye,” came back the wig-wag signal.
</p>
<p>
A number of officers of the post had gathered
to see the shooting, and a murmur of comment
ran over the little throng.
</p>
<p>
“Hickey!”
</p>
<p>
“To the bat!” muttered Sam under his breath,
taking his place. Hickey took long and careful
aim, lowered his gun for a free look at the target
then raised the weapon again. At last he
fired.
</p>
<p>
He too, made a bull’s-eye.
</p>
<p>
One round had been fired and without a single
miss on the part of any one of the three contestants.
This was continued for three more rounds
with no change in the result.
</p>
<p>
Excitement ran high. Nearly every apprentice
on the grounds was hoping that either the
red-haired boy or his companion might win.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>
Flink had few admirers, though all gave him
full credit for what he had accomplished so far
in the contest.
</p>
<p>
This time Dan was called to the mark first,
the officer in charge varying the routine for some
reason of his own.
</p>
<p>
Dan scored a bull’s-eye.
</p>
<p>
Flink came next. This time he shot with less
caution than before, and missed. Sam, however,
made a bull’s-eye.
</p>
<p>
“Tied, sir. Shall they shoot it off?” asked
the quartermaster, saluting the commandant of
the station.
</p>
<p>
“Shoot it off,” was the reply.
</p>
<p>
“Aye, aye, sir. Leaders take their places for
another round.”
</p>
<p>
Flink was called to the mark first. He was
plainly nervous. Perhaps his nervousness was
not lessened by the glimpse he caught of Sam
Hickey’s face. Sam was grinning broadly,
but he could not be accused of attempting to interfere
with Flink, because he was not looking
at him. Sam was looking at Dan at that particular
moment.
</p>
<p>
Flink took his sight, then pulled the trigger
with a nervous finger.
</p>
<p>
“Miss,” came the wig-wag signal.
</p>
<p>
Dan took his place and fired. He made a
bull’s-eye.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span>
</p>
<p>
Sam came next. As before he took a great
deal of time in preparation.
</p>
<p>
“He’s posing,” muttered Dan. “He might
better attend to his business.”
</p>
<p>
However, Sam Hickey knew what he was
about. If he missed, he would have the satisfaction
of knowing that it was not through carelessness.
</p>
<p>
At last he seemed satisfied as to his position,
arriving at which decision, he lost no time in
bringing the rifle to his shoulder and pulling
the trigger.
</p>
<p>
“Bull’s-eye!”
</p>
<p>
A great shout went up from the apprentices.
Discipline, for the moment, was swept aside.
Even the officers smiled approvingly as their
young charges threw hats high in the air, yelling
lustily, shouting the names of their champions.
Dan Davis and red-haired Sam had outshot
them all. As it had grown late, there was
no time for the two friends to shoot it off. Between
them, it was a tie.
</p>
<h2><a name='chIX' id='chIX'></a>CHAPTER IX—BETRAYED BY A STREAK OF RED</h2>
<p>
Dan got his promotion on the following
day, with an increase of pay, so that
the two boys now had the same rating
in the school.
</p>
<p>
Flink, however, had grown very surly. As
the days wore on he became more and more ugly
so far as the boys were concerned, but the latter
gave little heed to him.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, Sam and Dan had been progressing
rapidly. They had learned many
things. First, they had perfected themselves
in signaling, splicing, knot-tying and seamanship,
so far as was possible in the limited time
at their disposal. The Battleship Boys by their
application, hard work and keen minds, had won
the respect of their officers as well as of their
own associates. The frequent cruises about the
bay and down Long Island Sound of the
“Boxer” had given them practical experience
and agility; for by this time Sam and Dan were
able to cling to a yard arm in a rolling sea with
out being in the least disturbed. They were
as agile aloft as if they had been at sea in sailing
ships for years.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>
</p>
<p>
And now they were just completing their
course. A week remained for them to put the
finishing touches to it. Already they were looking
forward with keen anticipation to the day
when they should receive their summons to join
a ship. This might not come for some time, but
on account of their high standing they were reasonably
certain that they would be chosen with
the first detail of their class that went out.
</p>
<p>
During all this time, however, the Battleship
Boys had been subjected to petty annoyances
that both troubled and mystified them. Perhaps
they may have had some slight suspicion
as to the cause of their troubles, but if so, there
was no definite clue on which to base their suspicions.
</p>
<p>
First, something was found wrong with the
mechanism of Hickey’s rifle. Then next, Dan’s
Krag rifle was discovered at inspection to be in
a sad state of neglect. The inspection officer
said it was quite evident that the gun had not
been cleaned in weeks.
</p>
<p>
For both these offenses the lads were disciplined,
not seriously, but enough so that the
lesson might be impressed upon their minds.
</p>
<p>
Dan and Sam held many quiet talks over these
incidents. Sam was for going to one of their
superior officers and voicing their suspicions, but
of this Dan would not hear.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>
</p>
<p>
“We have got to prove ourselves men, no matter
if we do get some bad conduct marks by so
doing. And, besides, these things that have happened
to us may be the result of a mistake. For
instance, you remember that rifle on account of
which I was ordered to do extra duty?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” nodded Hickey.
</p>
<p>
“Well, that wasn’t my gun at all. It was
some one else’s Krag.”
</p>
<p>
“Then some one else took yours?” questioned
Sam, with rising color.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, but I think perhaps that was a mistake.”
</p>
<p>
“It wasn’t any mistake at all,” snapped Sam,
“and I’m going to keep my eyes open. I’ll get
even with the fellow who is trying to get us into
trouble—I’ll get even with him before we leave
the station, if I lose my job doing it.”
</p>
<p>
That afternoon there was to be a battalion
drill, and, after the morning’s work, all hands
hurried to quarters to get into their bright,
clean white uniforms. It was the one time in
the week when the apprentices were given an
opportunity to show themselves at their best.
Many people came out from town for this regular
Thursday afternoon drill, when every apprentice
at the station appeared on parade, with
flags waving, bands playing, the sunlight glistening
on polished weapons.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>
</p>
<p>
“This will be our last drill here, I hope,”
glowed Dan, as all preparations having been
made, the lads hurried out and falling in, started
for the drill ground, marching by fours.
</p>
<p>
All went well until the company in which the
two boys were marching had swung into line.
Then there came a sudden command:
</p>
<p>
“Halt!”
</p>
<p>
The petty officers in command ran their eyes
over the line in some surprise. They did not
understand what it meant. They knew, however,
that something had gone wrong.
</p>
<p>
The executive officer was standing to the rear
of the line, at some distance, while the battalion
was going through its evolutions. His observant
eyes had suddenly caught sight of something
that filled him with amazement and indignation.
</p>
<p>
Quickly striding down to the line, the men
facing away from him, he called the chief
quartermaster to him.
</p>
<p>
“Take those men out of line.”
</p>
<p>
“Which ones, sir?”
</p>
<p>
The executive officer, pointed, and then the
petty officer saw that which also amazed him.
A moment more and he had tapped both Dan
and Sam on the shoulder.
</p>
<p>
“Fall out!” he commanded.
</p>
<p>
They obeyed promptly, but wonderingly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>
</p>
<p>
“Report to your quarters, and remain there
in detention.”
</p>
<p>
The boys saluted and moved away.
</p>
<p>
“Now, will you tell me what this means?” demanded
Dan.
</p>
<p>
“That’s what I was trying to find out. We
haven’t done anything.”
</p>
<p>
They had reached their quarters when, all at
once, Dan uttered an exclamation.
</p>
<p>
“What is it?” demanded Sam.
</p>
<p>
“Look at yourself.”
</p>
<p>
“What’s wrong with me?” growled the
freckle-faced boy.
</p>
<p>
“Take off your jacket and you’ll see.”
</p>
<p>
“You had better take off your own while you
are about it,” replied Sam, opening his eyes
wide as he gazed at his companion.
</p>
<p>
With one accord they stripped off their jackets,
uttering exclamations of anger as they did
so.
</p>
<p>
The backs of the jackets were streaked with
bright red until they resembled the bars of the
American Flag, which they no doubt had been
intended by the perpetrator of the outrage to
represent.
</p>
<p>
Sam examined his jacket critically; then,
glancing up, he met the eyes of his companion.
</p>
<p>
“Red ink,” nodded Sam. “I’ll bet the eagle
will scream now.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span>
</p>
<p>
“Who could have done it?”
</p>
<p>
“The question is not who could have done it,
but who did do it.”
</p>
<p>
“We shall be held responsible, in any event.
I see ourselves losing our ratings and perhaps
missing our detail to a ship. Come, let’s get
into some decent clothes before one of the officers
gets here.”
</p>
<p>
They quickly changed their uniforms, laying
out the ruined ones, backs upward ready for the
inspection that they felt sure would soon follow.
</p>
<p>
In this surmise they were right. The drill
over, the quartermaster, accompanied by the
executive officer, Lieutenant Commander Devall,
appeared at the boys’ quarters.
</p>
<p>
Dan and Sam came to attention as the officers
entered.
</p>
<p>
The latter fixed their eyes upon the garments
laid out on the floor of the quarters. Lieutenant
Commander Devall picked up one of the
jackets, examining it closely.
</p>
<p>
“How did this happen?” he demanded, eyeing
Sam sternly.
</p>
<p>
“I do not know, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“The garment has plainly been inked. How
does it happen that you did not notice this when
you put on your uniform?”
</p>
<p>
“We dressed in a great hurry, sir,” spoke up
Dan. “As you will observe, it is quite dark in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>
here. It seems as if we ought to have noticed
that something was wrong, but we did not.”
</p>
<p>
Lieutenant Commander Devall pondered for
a moment.
</p>
<p>
“You have no idea who could have done this
thing, men?”
</p>
<p>
They did not answer.
</p>
<p>
“Search the quarters, quartermaster.”
</p>
<p>
The lads stood looking on with troubled faces
as the petty officer began his search. The Battleship
Boys did not know what the lieutenant
commander expected to find, and as a matter of
fact he probably had no definite idea himself.
</p>
<p>
Sam moved over to where his bag stood, having
observed that it was open. As he drew the
cord down tightly he chanced to glance at the
bag standing beside it. Hickey uttered a smothered
exclamation. What he had seen was a
smear of red at the mouth of the canvas bag.
</p>
<p>
“May I open this bag, sir?” he asked, saluting.
</p>
<p>
“For what?”
</p>
<p>
Sam pointed to the streak of red.
</p>
<p>
“Open it!”
</p>
<p>
One by one the lad drew out the neatly folded
garments from the sea bag, the officers scrutinizing
these keenly as they were withdrawn and
placed on the floor.
</p>
<p>
At the very bottom of the bag Sam came upon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>
an object which he quickly drew out, holding
it to the light, with a triumphant grin on his
face. He nodded to Dan as he did so.
</p>
<p>
The object was a towel. It was streaked with
red, as if some one had wiped his hands upon it.
In fact, finger marks were plainly visible all
over it.
</p>
<p>
The executive officer snatched the cloth from
the boy’s hands.
</p>
<p>
“Whose bag is this?” he demanded sharply.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll look up the number, sir,” answered the
quartermaster.
</p>
<p>
At that moment a figure darkened the doorway.
It was Flink. The instant he saw the
officers in the quarters his hand mechanically
came up in salute.
</p>
<p>
A ray of sunlight slanted across the hand as
he stood there. Sam caught his breath sharply,
then an eager look overspread his face. He
hesitated a moment; then, springing over to
where Flink was standing, Sam grabbed the
hand, jerking it sharply down, examining it
briefly in the few seconds that elapsed ere Flink
could resist.
</p>
<p>
“Attention!” commanded Lieutenant Commander
Devall. “What does this mean?”
</p>
<p>
“If you will examine this man’s hand, I think
you will understand, sir,” answered Sam, saluting.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>
</p>
<p>
The lieutenant commander stepped over to
Flink.
</p>
<p>
“Let me see your hands. Palms up!”
</p>
<p>
The palms were smeared with red.
</p>
<p>
“Is that your sea bag yonder?”
</p>
<p>
Flink nodded.
</p>
<p>
“So, you are the man who is responsible for
this, are you? What have you to say for yourself?”
</p>
<p>
The apprentice hung his head, making no reply.
</p>
<p>
“You are released from quarters, Davis and
Hickey. I begin to understand a few of the
things that have happened here. Quartermaster,
place this man under arrest. Turn him over
to the master-at-arms with instructions to lock
him in the brig.”
</p>
<h2><a name='chX' id='chX'></a>CHAPTER X—THEIR FIRST DETAIL</h2>
<p>
Summary court-martial met on the following
afternoon. Louis Flink was found
guilty, the recommendation of the court
being that he be dismissed from the service.
</p>
<p>
At a general muster the findings of the court-martial,
approved by the commandant of the
station, were read out by the executive officer.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>
It was an impressive scene to the Battleship
Boys—one that they never forgot, showing as
it did that the United States Navy is no place
for a man guilty of a dishonorable act.
</p>
<p>
Louis Flink was read out of the service and
driven from the grounds of the Training Station,
a disgraced man.
</p>
<p>
“I’m sorry for the poor fellow, though I have
no sympathy for him,” murmured Dan.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the difference?” demanded Sam.
</p>
<p>
“Difference between what?”
</p>
<p>
“The difference between feeling sorry for a
man and having sympathy for him? I, for one,
am mighty glad to see him go, but I’m sorry
I did not get a chance at him first. I’ll never
get over that.”
</p>
<p>
“He must have been the one who was the
cause of our other trouble, Sam.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course he was, beginning with the pie
he threw at us. But what are we going to do
with the marks against us? We were no more
to blame for the things we were disciplined for
than we are for having our jackets ruined.”
</p>
<p>
“We shall have to take our medicine; that
is all,” answered Dan ruefully.
</p>
<p>
Two days later, the boys were summoned to
the office of the executive officer. They went
rather apprehensively, wondering what could
be the reason for the unusual summons.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span>
</p>
<p>
Arriving at the executive office the lads stated
their business to the sentry, and were admitted
after a little delay, coming to a halt and saluting
as they reached Lieutenant Commander
Devall’s desk.
</p>
<p>
The salute was quickly answered, after which
the boys stood at attention, hats in hands.
</p>
<p>
“I presume you would like to join a ship,
would you not?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
“Join a ship? Indeed we should,” answered
Dan, his eyes glowing with pleasure.
</p>
<p>
“You boys, I believe, joined from the same
place?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“H-m-m-m!” mused the executive officer, consulting
the enlistment record of the two apprentices.
“Piedmont?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“You would like to be shipmates, would you
not?”
</p>
<p>
“We should like it very much, indeed. If it
were possible, I wish we might be placed on the
same ship,” replied Dan.
</p>
<p>
“I will arrange it,” replied Lieutenant Commander
Devall, consulting several papers from
the mass with which his desk was littered.
“Several details are being sent out to various
ships to-day. I was under the impression that
one ship on my list asked for two ordinary seamen.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>
Ah, yes, here it is. Yes, that will be all
right. I shall assign you, but, of course, I cannot
promise that you will be retained indefinitely
in that way. You may be reassigned to
some other part of the service at any time, but
it is not likely that this will be done for some
time, yet.”
</p>
<p>
“May I ask, sir, to what ship you will assign
us?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes; the battleship ‘Long Island.’”
</p>
<p>
“The ‘Long Island,’” mused Dan.
</p>
<p>
“The ‘Long Island,’” repeated Sam under
his breath.
</p>
<p>
“That is the new battleship, is it not, sir?”
</p>
<p>
“The newest one in the Atlantic fleet. She
has just had her trial trip, and has been accepted
by the government. I am very glad to
be able to give you this detail, for you are a
pair of likely young men. Your record at the
station has been a splendid one, and your promotion
deserved.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you, sir. You know we have some
marks against us,” spoke up Dan.
</p>
<p>
“I was thinking of that. Let me see. There
appears to be some doubt about those extra
duty tours—I mean to say as to whether you
men were wholly in the wrong. Have you any
reason to suspect that others were trying to get
you into trouble?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir; we have had reason to suspect as
much,” answered Dan after an instant’s hesitation.
</p>
<p>
“Whom did you suspect?”
</p>
<p>
“There can be no harm now, sir, in saying
that we suspected the fellow Flink.”
</p>
<p>
“Yet you made no report of it?”
</p>
<p>
“How could we, sir? We had little on which
to base our suspicions, and besides it did not
seem the manly thing to do, to carry tales about
one’s shipmates.”
</p>
<p>
“He’s the fellow, sir, who threw the pie,”
spoke up Hickey.
</p>
<p>
“What’s that?”
</p>
<p>
“Threw the pie.” Sam did not heed the
warning look from his companion. “The day
we entered the training school.”
</p>
<p>
“I recall the incident, and I also recall that
you both refused to state what you knew. Always
obey the command of an officer; bear that
in mind, young men. No matter if it does mean
getting an associate into trouble. Your officers
will never make a request of you that is not for
the good of the service. You are well fitted for
the duties that are before you. Be obedient,
courteous and willing. Never allow soreheads—‘sea
lawyers’ we call them on board ship—to
make you discontented on board. Remember
that there is no more honorable calling in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>
world than that which you have chosen. See
that you do honor to it.”
</p>
<p>
“We shall try, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“And, by the way, you are entitled to a leave
of absence for four weeks from this time, with
a full allowance of pay. You may join your
ship later, at the expiration of leave. I take
it that you lads would like to go home and show
yourselves in your uniforms.”
</p>
<p>
Dan hesitated.
</p>
<p>
“Of course, we should like it, sir, but I think
we should prefer to join ship at once.”
</p>
<p>
“Very good, then; you will join the ‘Long
Island’ to-morrow. In the meantime I shall
arrange to have the marks against you canceled,
so that there may be no bar to your
progress. You will go aboard with a clean bill
of health in every way.”
</p>
<p>
“May I ask where the ‘Long Island’ is, sir?”
questioned Sam.
</p>
<p>
“New York.”
</p>
<p>
“At the Navy Yard, sir?”
</p>
<p>
“No, she is lying in the North River; I think
about off Riverside Drive. Do you know where
that is?”
</p>
<p>
“No, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“That is nearly opposite General Grant’s
tomb. You can find the place easily. Any
policeman will tell you how to get there.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir; when do we go, sir?”
</p>
<p>
“On the night boat. You came up here on
that, did you not?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“I will have your papers prepared and your
transportation ready at five o’clock. You will
call here for them. The quartermaster will instruct
you as to what you are to take with you
and how to proceed. My lads, I trust I shall
hear good reports from you. We always feel
a keen interest in the young men who have had
their first instruction here at the Training
School. That will be all.”
</p>
<p>
Two hands were brought to foreheads in precise
salute, and, executing a right about face,
the Battleship Boys, marched steadily from the
room, their faces grave, their shoulders thrown
well back.
</p>
<p>
Once outside, Sam turned a bronzed, freckled
face toward his companion.
</p>
<p>
“We are the people—the real people—aren’t
we, Dan?” he questioned, with a sly wink.
</p>
<p>
“We are,” answered Dan soberly.
</p>
<p>
The heads of the Battleship Boys were in a
whirl of expectancy for the rest of the day.
The afternoon hours dragged slowly along, but
at last the evening mess was over, and they
quickly gathered their dunnage, starting for
the New York boat with light and happy hearts.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span>
</p>
<p>
Each boy had nearly fifty dollars in his
pockets as the result of his three months’ service
at the Training Station. This money, however,
they had decided to deposit with the paymaster
of the ‘Long Island’ as soon as possible
after arriving on board.
</p>
<p>
The next morning Dan and Sam were up just
as the Fall River Line boat was about to pass
under the Brooklyn bridge.
</p>
<p>
“Look!” cried Dan. “Do you recognize that
yellow building over there?”
</p>
<p>
“Can’t say that I do. What building is it?”
</p>
<p>
“It is the recruiting station where you and
I joined the service three months ago. And
now, just think of it, we are jackies. Everybody
knows we are jackies as soon as they look
at our handsome uniforms.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” breathed Sam, “and there’s the very
Flag under which we enlisted.”
</p>
<p>
Instinctively the Battleship Boys removed
their caps and came to attention, in which position
they stood until the towering Sound
steamer had swept on and began rounding the
Battery.
</p>
<h2><a name='chXI' id='chXI'></a>CHAPTER XI—ON BOARD A BATTLESHIP</h2>
<p>
“Small boat with two enlisted men approaching,
sir,” called out the deck
watch of the big battleship “Long
Island.”
</p>
<p>
“What ship?” answered the officer of the
deck.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know, sir. Can’t make them out
exactly.”
</p>
<p>
The small boat, manned by a perspiring boatman,
was creeping nearer and nearer to the
huge, drab-colored man-of-war, whose towering
sides and huge masts dwarfed everything else
about it.
</p>
<p>
The small boat pulled up to the starboard or
right side of the ship, and drifted in.
</p>
<p>
“Boat, ahoy!” called down the quartermaster,
making a megaphone of his hands. “What
do you want?”
</p>
<p>
“We want to come aboard, sir?” answered
Dan, rising in the fragile skiff and saluting.
</p>
<p>
“Who are you?”
</p>
<p>
“Recruits from the Newport Training Station,
assigned to this ship.”
</p>
<div class='figcenter' style='padding-top: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em'>
<a name='i001' id='i001'></a>
<img src="images/illus-101.jpg" alt="“We Want to Come Aboard, Sir!”" title=""/><br />
<span class='caption'>“We Want to Come Aboard, Sir!”</span>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span></div>
<p>
“Then you ought to know better than to try
to board a man-o’-war on the starboard side.
Get around to the port side where you belong.”
</p>
<p>
“Aye, aye, sir,” answered Dan, touching his
cap.
</p>
<p>
“How are you going to know which is the port
side of these tubs?” muttered Sam, shading his
eyes from the sun and gazing at the ship. “I’m
blest if both ends don’t look alike to me.”
</p>
<p>
“Then you must be losing your eyesight, Sam.
Don’t you see how the quarter-deck is cut away
astern, while the bow stands high out of the
water? Then there’s the Flag astern. You’ll
never see the colors up forward.”
</p>
<p>
“I can’t see everything at once, and you must
remember that this is the first time I ever saw
a real battleship close enough to touch it.”
</p>
<p>
The ship was at anchor, and some distance out
in the stream. A swaying rope ladder hung from
the lower boom on the port side, reaching down
to within some four feet of the water’s edge.
</p>
<p>
The river was choppy that morning, and the
little boat bobbed perilously. The boys were
used to this, however, and gave no thought to it.
</p>
<p>
“Will you please pass a line over here for
our dunnage?” called Dan.
</p>
<p>
“Pass the landlubbers a clothes line,” shouted
a voice from the forecastle.
</p>
<p>
A line, coiled, suddenly shot down from above.
Sam chanced to be standing up in the boat at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>
that moment. The line hit him fairly on the
top of his red head, flattening him on the bottom
of the skiff.
</p>
<p>
A shout went up from the forecastle.
</p>
<p>
“You lubbers!” bellowed Sam, scrambling to
his feet, nearly upsetting the skiff in his efforts
to get his eyes on the man who was responsible
for knocking him down. “I’d duck you if I
had you down here.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, you would!” came back the prompt
answer.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I would.”
</p>
<p>
“Come up here and try it, red-head! We’ve
got some shower baths up in the forecastle.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t answer him, Sam,” cautioned Dan.
“There is an officer watching us, and we do not
want him to think we are a couple of rowdies.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, we aren’t, are we?” demanded Sam
indignantly.
</p>
<p>
“Certainly not. All the more reason why we
should act like gentlemen.”
</p>
<p>
Sam grumbled some unintelligible reply.
</p>
<p>
“Are you going first, Dan?”
</p>
<p>
“It makes no difference.”
</p>
<p>
Dan grasped the swaying rope ladder, known
as a “Jacob’s ladder,” and ran up with agility.
</p>
<p>
“My, the little man must have made a voyage
to Africa and taken lessons from the
monkeys,” jeered a voice.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>
</p>
<p>
“It isn’t necessary to go to Africa to find
specimens of that animal,” answered Dan,
reaching the lower boom, along which he ran
lightly, sprang over the rail and planted his
feet on the deck. His first duty was to turn his
face toward the stern of the ship and salute the
Flag.
</p>
<p>
By this time Hickey was on his way up the
ladder, and in a moment more he awkwardly
measured his length on the deck, having caught
his toe in the rope railing in scaling it.
</p>
<p>
The men of the forecastle set up a shout of
approval.
</p>
<p>
“That’s the way to do it, lad! A regular
human projectile. We don’t need any torpedoes
when you are on board.”
</p>
<p>
Sam got up, blushing furiously. As he rose
a jackie ran his fingers through the shock of
red hair.
</p>
<p>
“Shipmate, you’d better keep away from the
magazines with that head of hair, or there’ll be
an explosion that will be heard all the way to
Newport.”
</p>
<p>
“People who play with fire sometimes get
burned. You’d better stand clear,” warned
Hickey, whereat their was another shout, this
time at the expense of the jackie who had taken
the liberty with Sam’s head.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll bet the Old Man will send his orderly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>
on a run for the barber when he sees red-head
here,” vouchsafed another.
</p>
<p>
The “Old Man” aboard ship means the captain.
</p>
<p>
The lads gave no further heed to the chaffing
of their new shipmates. Dan nudged his companion
and motioned for the latter to follow
him.
</p>
<p>
“Where?” demanded Sam. “You don’t
know where you are going.”
</p>
<p>
“We must report to the officer of the deck
first of all. Lieutenant Commander Devall told
me to do so.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I didn’t think you would know enough
to do it of your own accord,” was Sam’s withering
reply as he turned to follow Dan.
</p>
<p>
The lads made their way over the superstructure,
where they were treated to various
good-natured criticisms hurled at them by
jackies and marines lounging along the deck.
</p>
<p>
Descending the iron steps that led down to
the quarter-deck, the Battleship Boys once more
came to attention and saluted the Flag. The
officer of the deck brought his right hand to the
visor of his cap in acknowledgment of the salute.
</p>
<p>
The boys stepped up to him, saluting once
more.
</p>
<p>
“Well, men, what is it?”
</p>
<p>
“We are recruits from the Training Station
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span>
at Newport, sir. We have come to join the ship,
sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Very good. Messenger!”
</p>
<p>
A sailor came to him on the run, saluting as
he brought up sharply in front of the young
ensign who was acting as officer of the deck.
</p>
<p>
“Take these men to the master-at-arms.”
</p>
<p>
The messenger crooked a finger; the Battleship
Boys saluted the officer of the deck, and,
turning, followed their guide. He led them
through narrow corridors, up through the gun
deck, where the butts of the great eight-inch
guns lay shining in the sunlight that filtered
down through open hatches.
</p>
<p>
At last he halted before a curtained doorway
and rapped.
</p>
<p>
“What it is?” came a voice from inside.
</p>
<p>
“Officer of the deck directs you to receive
two recruits who have just come on board, sir.”
</p>
<p>
The curtain parted and the lads saw before
them a kindly faced man, whose weather-beaten
features testified to many months of exposure
to wind and sun on the high seas.
</p>
<p>
“Come in, lads,” he said. “Have you your
papers with you?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir,” answered Dan, extending their
record papers.
</p>
<p>
“All clear,” said the master-at-arms after a
brief glance over the documents. “The Training School
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span>
gives you a special good-conduct
mention, I see. That is well. Follow me.”
</p>
<p>
Once more the process of diving through narrow
passageways, down iron companionways,
with chains for hand rails, turning sharp corners,
trumping their elbows on projections and
the like, was gone through with.
</p>
<p>
“What are they trying to do with us?” whispered
Sam.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know.”
</p>
<p>
“Guess they’re trying out our wind to see
whether we are any good or not. This certainly
is a sprint. If they keep it up much
longer I’ll change my mind again and go
ashore.”
</p>
<p>
Just then the master-at-arms rapped on the
casing of another door, and, at command, entered,
motioning the boys to follow.
</p>
<p>
They were now standing before the ship’s
writer. The writer, after looking over their
papers, entered their record in a large book on
his desk. Following this he asked them many
questions about their past life, going over much
the same ground that the recruiting officer had
done when they enlisted in New York. After
satisfying himself on all points, the writer said:
</p>
<p>
“I will assign you to a deck division for the
present. Here are the numbers for your sea
bags and hammocks. Here are your ditty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>
boxes.” He handed to the lads two boxes each
about a foot square, neatly made and varnished.
A lock and key was attached to each, and on
the top of each box was a number.
</p>
<p>
Sam took his box under his arm. He seemed
to be doubtful as to just what he was expected
to do with the box, but at the moment he had
no opportunity to ask, for once more the master-at-arms
was beckoning the boys to follow
him.
</p>
<p>
“There he goes again. Another sprinting
match,” muttered Hickey. “I shall have an
appetite when I get through with this race.”
</p>
<p>
“You don’t need exercise to give you an appetite,”
retorted Dan. “That’s one of the
things you always have with you.”
</p>
<p>
They were going forward through the interior
of the ship, though by this time Sam had lost
his bearings entirely. He could not have told
whether they were going forward or aft.
</p>
<p>
“Two recruits just come aboard, sir,” announced
the master-at-arms.
</p>
<p>
This time it was to the boatswain’s mate that
they were introduced.
</p>
<p>
“Come in, lads,” he said in a voice that Sam
afterwards decided must have come from the
boatswain’s boots. The voice was deep and
hoarse and fearsome, but the smile that followed
the words was entirely reassuring.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>
</p>
<p>
“He isn’t half as fierce as he looks,” muttered
Hickey in a whisper so loud and plain as
to reach the ears of the boatswain’s mate. The
latter smiled broadly.
</p>
<p>
“No; you need not be afraid of me, my lads.
The boatswain’s mate is supposed to be a sort
of father and mother, all in one, to the raw
recruit. I suppose you have learned everything
there is to know since you have been at the
Newport station, have you not?”
</p>
<p>
“We have learned some things, but I fear
there are still many things for us to learn,” replied
Dan, with a half smile.
</p>
<p>
“Just so. You have learned to make all the
various knots that a sailor is supposed to be
familiar with?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir,” answered the boys in chorus.
</p>
<p>
“And belay a fall?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir; we know how to take a turn on a
cleat with a rope.
</p>
<p>
“Very good. Hickey, my lad, now that you
know how to belay a fall, I will ask if you can
pass a stopper?”
</p>
<p>
A blank expression appeared on Sam’s face,
while a twinkle showed in the eyes of the boatswain’s
mate.
</p>
<p>
“I—I don’t know, sir. If the stopper were
good to eat I don’t think I should pass it unless
I were walking in my sleep.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>
</p>
<p>
The boatswain’s mate leaned back and
laughed uproariously.
</p>
<p>
“Passing a stopper, my lad, means to wrap
a rope about a fall while another belays it.
There are a lot of these sea terms that you will
learn as you go along. I see you have been
assigned to the deck. What branch of the service
would you prefer to be in, or haven’t you
thought about the matter seriously?”
</p>
<p>
“I think we should prefer to be on one of the
guns—in a gun squad, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s my idea, too; but, first of all, serve
some time on deck. You will learn a great deal
there. I will instruct you carefully in your
duties and show you your billet, after which
you will go forward and get acquainted with
your shipmates.”
</p>
<p>
“Will you tell me, sir, what I do with this
casket?” inquired Sam.
</p>
<p>
“The ditty box?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I guess that is what the other man
called it.”
</p>
<p>
The boatswain’s mate smiled good-naturedly.
</p>
<p>
“That is for the purpose of holding your
valuables.”
</p>
<p>
“Money?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no, it would not be exactly safe. You
had better place your money in the hands of
the paymaster.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>
</p>
<p>
“That is what we intend to do,” spoke up
Dan.
</p>
<p>
“The ditty box, my lads, is the sailor’s most
treasured possession. In it he keeps his trinkets,
his pictures, his letters, his pen and paper.
But this is not all. The ditty box serves as the
jackie’s desk, his table, his seat and many other
things. Never interfere with another man’s
ditty box unless you are looking for trouble.
You will get it fast enough if you do so.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll be too busy looking after my own to
want to bother chasing the other fellow’s ditto
box.”
</p>
<p>
“Ditty,” corrected Dan.
</p>
<p>
“All right. It’s all the same.”
</p>
<p>
“I will now show you through the ship, as
you will be required to be familiar with it.
Learn all you can. Learn the name of everything
on board, for all this knowledge will be
needed some of these days when you come up
for promotion. I presume you have ambitions
to rise to higher grades?”
</p>
<p>
“We are going to do so, sir,” answered Dan
promptly.
</p>
<p>
“That is the way to talk. You will win with
that spirit. Nothing can stop you. Now, come
with me and take a look at the ‘Long Island.’”
</p>
<p>
“There we go again,” laughed Sam. “What
time do we mess, sir?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>
</p>
<p>
“Very soon, now. I shall get you back in
plenty of time.”
</p>
<p>
They started out on their first tour of inspection
of a battleship and the boys uttered many
exclamations of wonder as the parts of the great
floating machine and implement of war were
revealed and explained to them.
</p>
<p>
The boatswain’s mate took them first to the
bridge, where the compass and steering wheel
were located; thence to the fire control, a steel-bound
enclosure, open at the top, just forward
of the bridge. It was from there, he told them,
that the electric signals were given for torpedo
firing.
</p>
<p>
“Is this a torpedo boat also?” questioned
Sam innocently.
</p>
<p>
“Certainly not. This is a battleship. It is
provided, however, with two torpedo tubes, a
starboard and a port tube.”
</p>
<p>
From this point the lads went down, deeper
and deeper into the ship, By this time there
were no stairways to walk down. In place of
them were narrow ladders running through
narrow apertures in the various decks.
</p>
<p>
As he went along the boatswain’s mate briefly
explained everything, going into detail regarding
the handling of the big guns, the ammunition
hoists and the electric signaling plant far
down amidships. They did not complete their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>
journey until they were far below the level of
the water in the very bottom of the ship.
</p>
<p>
From there they made their way upward to
the wireless telegraph room, where the operator
was sitting with receiver on his head, listening
for the faint ticking of the messages that might
be hurled through the air.
</p>
<p>
Now and then the operator would nervously
clutch his key.
</p>
<p>
Sam jumped when the resonators crashed
forth their message to another far-away operator;
then the sending instruments settled down
to a steady squealing.
</p>
<p>
“Reminds me of Bill Thompson’s pigs,”
nodded Sam. “That’s the kind of a noise they
make when they get an appetite.”
</p>
<p>
At last the lads completed their tour.
</p>
<p>
“Stand by the starboard anchor chain!”
</p>
<p>
The command was given from the bridge as
the lads emerged from the forward hatchway.
Glancing up they saw several officers in their
white uniforms standing on the bridge of the
ship.
</p>
<p>
“I guess we must be going to get under way,
sir,” said Dan.
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
The “Long Island” had swung with the tide
until she was headed down the river. Groups
of expectant jackies thronged the forward deck.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>
To one side stood the members of the ship’s
band, instruments in hand.
</p>
<p>
“Stand clear of the starboard anchor chain,”
came the second command from the bridge.
“Up with the starboard anchor.”
</p>
<p>
A rattling of chains followed instantly as the
anchor was quickly raised by electric power
until its stock was level with the forward deck.
</p>
<p>
“Starboard anchor shipped, sir,” was the answer
from the forward deck.
</p>
<p>
“Aye, aye!”
</p>
<p>
The captain, who had been standing looking
over the forecastle from the bridge, now turned
to the midshipman at the bridge telegraph,
from which signals are transmitted to the engine
room.
</p>
<p>
“Slow speed ahead, both engines,” commanded
the captain.
</p>
<p>
A tremor ran through the ship and at the
same instant the Stars and Stripes fluttered
from the gaff, showing that the ship was under
motion.
</p>
<p>
At that moment the band struck up a lively
tune. With one accord the jackies threw their
arms about each other and began waltzing about
the deck, raising their voices in song as they
spun around.
</p>
<p>
The Battleship Boys, however, did not sing.
Their eyes were swimming with happiness,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>
their hearts were full of patriotism. The throb
of the engines was borne faintly to their ears,
and the great ship, turning her prow seaward,
headed slowly for the Narrows.
</p>
<h2><a name='chXII' id='chXII'></a>CHAPTER XII—IN THE DECK DIVISION</h2>
<p>
“Deck division turn out to swab down
decks!” bellowed the boatswain’s
mate.
</p>
<p>
The ship had poked her nose out into the open
sea by this time, the “Long Island” rising and
falling gracefully on an easy swell.
</p>
<p>
“What did he say?” questioned Sam.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll confess that I did not understand a
word of it,” answered Dan. “I don’t see why
those mates cannot talk plain United States.”
</p>
<p>
The command was followed by a bustling
about the decks. Men hurriedly brought out
their deck swabs, implements somewhat resembling
mops. Others brought pails which they
filled from the taps on deck, while still others
coupled hose to pipes along the sea gutters.
</p>
<p>
Sam felt a hand on his shoulder.
</p>
<p>
“What division are you in?” demanded a
gruff voice.
</p>
<p>
“The deck division, sir.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>
</p>
<p>
“Then what are you doing here?” said a boatswain’s
mate that they had not seen before, glaring
at them.
</p>
<p>
“I—I don’t know, sir,” stammered Sam.
</p>
<p>
“Will you tell us what we are to do?” spoke
up Dan. “You see, it is our first day on board.”
</p>
<p>
“Do? Do?” exploded the mate. “Get a
swab and go to work; that’s what you are to do.
What do you think this is, a liner where you
can loll around and look pretty?”
</p>
<p>
“We are ready to work, if you will show us.
Where will we find swabs?” questioned Dan.
</p>
<p>
The mate conducted them to a chest in which
the swabs were kept.
</p>
<p>
“Take your swabs and hurry aft to the quarter-deck.
That’s your station,” he directed.
</p>
<p>
By the time the boys reached the quarter-deck
their mates were already at work, moving along
swiftly, pushing their swabs ahead of them.
</p>
<p>
“Take off your shoes. What do you mean by
coming here with your shoes on?” demanded
the mate.
</p>
<p>
Somewhat hesitatingly Dan and Sam removed
their shoes and stockings, rolled up their trousers
and joined their fellows in scrubbing down
the decks.
</p>
<p>
Sam was surly. He plainly did not like the
assignment.
</p>
<p>
“This is a tough job,” he confided to his companion.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>
“I didn’t join the Navy to make a
washerwoman of myself.”
</p>
<p>
“We have got to learn, old chap. We must
take our turn. If we complain, we are not fit for
the service. You may be an admiral some day;
who knows?”
</p>
<p>
“An admiral? Huh! Nice chance I’ve got
to become an admiral—admiral of the scrub
gang, you mean.”
</p>
<p>
“Pipe down the guff,” commanded the mate
sternly.
</p>
<p>
“What’s that mean?” muttered Sam.
</p>
<p>
“I think he means we are to stop talking.”
</p>
<p>
For the next hour there was a steady splash,
splash as the swabs worked back and forth over
the deck, the latter running rivers of water from
hose and pail.
</p>
<p>
“Well, how do you like Field Day?” questioned
the mate who had first instructed the lads
in their duties.
</p>
<p>
It was after the mess hour and all hands were
resting preparatory to taking up the duties of
the afternoon.
</p>
<p>
“What’s a Field Day?” asked Sam.
</p>
<p>
“When all hands turn to to clean ship. You
see, ships get in rather bad condition, regarding
cleanliness, after having been in port for some
time.”
</p>
<p>
“Do the men like to clean ship?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span>
</p>
<p>
“They love it. Give a jackie a deck swab,
put him in bare feet, and he is happy.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t see anything to get excited about in
scrubbing decks,” grumbled Sam.
</p>
<p>
“You will after you have been in the service
longer. By the way, the smoke lamp is lighted.
Fall to, lads.”
</p>
<p>
“You mean——”
</p>
<p>
“Go take your smoke. Light up your pipes.”
</p>
<p>
“We do not smoke, sir,” replied Dan.
</p>
<p>
“No, we don’t smoke,” added Sam. “But we
eat.”
</p>
<p>
“That is all right. A great many of the boys
do not smoke these days, and it is a good thing.
Now, in my time, everybody smoked. But things
have changed on the sea as well as elsewhere.”
</p>
<p>
“Attention!” called a voice.
</p>
<p>
The boys stiffened instinctively. They did
not know the reason for the command, but experience
had taught them that it was well to obey
that command whenever heard.
</p>
<p>
It was the captain who was approaching, on
his way to the bridge.
</p>
<p>
His hand came up in salute as he glanced
quickly at them.
</p>
<p>
“Carry on, lads,” he said, whereat the Battleship
Boys and their shipmates resumed their
interrupted conversation.
</p>
<p>
“You will find the Old Man a splendid officer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>
and very kind to you boys,” said the mate.
“I’ve been under him for ten years, and there
ain’t a man in the world who’s got a bigger
heart than he, especially for the jackies. He
loves them, every one of them.”
</p>
<p>
Soon after that, the boys went forward. Sitting
under the shining twelve-inch guns, either
of which would carry an eight hundred pound
projectile twelve miles, they talked in low tones
until the bugle sounded the command to scrub
decks again.
</p>
<p>
Throughout the afternoon, until eight bells,
that is four o’clock, the steady scrub, scrub, continued,
the men now and then conversing in low
tones.
</p>
<p>
“How long does this scrubbing business keep
up?” asked Sam when he met the boatswain’s
mate later in the afternoon.
</p>
<p>
“Let’s see; you enlisted for four years?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, that’s it.”
</p>
<p>
“What is it?”
</p>
<p>
“The scrubbing. We are always scrubbing
aboard ship; that is, when we are not painting.
Do you like to paint?”
</p>
<p>
“I never tried.”
</p>
<p>
“You will have a chance to do so to-morrow.
We shall probably anchor off the Delaware
breakwater to-morrow morning; then all hands
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>
will turn to and paint ship. Next to scrubbing
decks the jackie is never so happy as when he
has a paint brush in his hands.”
</p>
<p>
But Sam was doubtful. He decided that he
would much prefer to be an officer. When the
day was ended both boys had appetites that
would not bear trifling with. Mess, that night,
was a real meal so far as they were concerned.
Sam had a third helping of everything on the
bill.
</p>
<p>
“Have some more canned Willie,” urged a
shipmate.
</p>
<p>
“Willie? Who’s he?”
</p>
<p>
“Willie is meat.”
</p>
<p>
“Red-head, you keep on eating that way your
first day out, and Pills will have a job putting
you on your feet again,” suggested another
sailor.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll take the chance,” mumbled Sam, his
mouth full of food. “It won’t be the first
chance I’ve taken in this line of duty, either.
But who is Mr. Pills?”
</p>
<p>
“‘Pills,’” laughed the sailor, “is the doctor.”
</p>
<p>
By the time supper had been finished the
breeze had freshened considerably and the
“Long Island” was pitching heavily. The
watch was called on duty about this time, but
being raw men the two boys were not to have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span>
this duty put upon them just yet. Instead, they
repaired to the forward deck, where they lay
down against the big gun turret, to rest after
their day’s work.
</p>
<p>
The smoke lamp had been lighted, and many
of their companions were stretched about on the
deck, smoking, telling stories or discussing the
latest news that they had heard while in port.
In the lighted corridors men might be seen sitting
on the floor with their ditty boxes on their
knees, writing letters.
</p>
<p>
About this time, the band came out, electric
lights were strung over the deck on the starboard
side, where the musicians would be protected
from the strong breeze, and chairs
brought out for the players.
</p>
<p>
Soon the regular evening concert began. The
voices of the sailors were stilled; under the
spell of the music many heads drooped, many
tired eyes closed for a few moments of delicious
sleep.
</p>
<p>
“Isn’t it glorious?” breathed Dan.
</p>
<p>
“It might be if things weren’t so upside
down,” complained Sam.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter? Aren’t you feeling
well?”
</p>
<p>
“I have felt better,” answered Sam in a
husky voice. “I guess I’ll take a walk.”
</p>
<p>
His walk did not last long. Sam took a turn
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>
once across the deck, then settled down beside
his companion, holding his head between his
hands.
</p>
<p>
“Why, Sam, are you really ill?” questioned
Dan, his voice full of concern.
</p>
<p>
“Ill? I think I’m going to die. Ugh!” Sam
stretched out on the deck flat on his back.
</p>
<p>
“Sam Hickey, I believe you are seasick,” exclaimed
Dan.
</p>
<p>
Sam’s only answer was a long-drawn moan.
</p>
<h2><a name='chXIII' id='chXIII'></a>CHAPTER XIII—RESENTING AN INSULT</h2>
<p>
The services of two jackies were required
to boost Hickey into his hammock that
night at nine o’clock, when hammocks
were piped up.
</p>
<p>
At five o’clock next morning, when the bugle
piped all hands out, the red-haired Jackie was
in a sad state. His hair was standing up like
the quill of a porcupine, fairly bristling with
disorder. When Dan helped him down to the
deck Sam fell in a heap.
</p>
<p>
“Brace up!” urged Dan. “Don’t let them
think you a landlubber.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t care what they think. I’m a sick
man.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>
</p>
<p>
“Never mind; you will feel better after you
get some hot breakfast inside of you.”
</p>
<p>
“Breakfast! Waugh!”
</p>
<p>
Dan helped his chum to the shower baths,
where Sam took a cold bath that tuned him up
considerably. He was still very uncertain on
his feet, however, as he made his way forward
for his deck swab, for the first duty of the day
was to take up his occupation of swabbing decks.
</p>
<p>
Sam’s footsteps lagged that morning. He was
several paces behind the other swabbers all the
time.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter, red-head?” questioned
one of the jackies.
</p>
<p>
“I’m sick, that’s all.”
</p>
<p>
“Trying to work the list, eh?” asked another.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know what working the list may be,
but I’m anything you want to call me.”
</p>
<p>
“He means getting on the binnacle list,”
</p>
<p>
“What’s that?” wondered Sam.
</p>
<p>
“Being excused by the doctor for one day on
account of a fit of laziness that makes a fellow
think he’s sick.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t think; I know,” was the lad’s muttered
response. However, Sam resolutely stuck
to his work, though every plunge of the battleship
threatened him with a final collapse to the
deck.
</p>
<p>
Somehow, he managed to pull himself through
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>
that long morning without, as he called it, “disgracing
myself.” When the command came,
“knock off scrubbing decks,” Sam broke ranks
and ran for the forecastle. He did not dare
trust himself to walk, for he feared he would
be unable to keep on his feet.
</p>
<p>
But his headlong course was an unsafe one
through the narrow corridors of a man-of-war,
and many a jackie and marine’s shins were
rapped soundly by the handle of the deck swab,
during Sam’s wild dash. The jackies yelled
at him, now and then one hurling something at
the fleeing lad, but Sam did not stop until something
finally happened to check his mad career.
</p>
<p>
Somehow his swab handle was thrust between
the feet of a man standing with his back to the
lad. This occurred on the gun deck.
</p>
<p>
The man went down flat on his face, and Sam
likewise tripped over the handle of the deck
swab, plunging headlong on the fallen man.
</p>
<p>
There was instant commotion. Those of the
crew who chanced to be standing about set up a
roar of laughter.
</p>
<p>
“Look out, Bill. His head will set fire to your
uniform,” shouted one of them.
</p>
<p>
Sam was struggling to his feet, very red in
the face and very much ashamed of his clumsiness.
He started forward to help the other man
up, when the latter regained his feet with a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span>
bound. The man’s face was bloody, a deep gash
having appeared across his nose.
</p>
<p>
“Did the red-head do you up, Kester?”
shouted several voices at once.
</p>
<p>
Bill Kester, in falling, had struck a sharp
edge on the carriage of an eight-inch gun, and
had sustained a painful wound. Besides this, his
face was smeared with grease that it had collected
in scraping along the carriage.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I’m so sorry,” begged Sam.
</p>
<p>
Kester was mopping the blood and grime from
his face, regardless of the fact that the sleeve
with which he was performing the operation
would not stand an inspection.
</p>
<p>
“It was an accident. Believe me, I could not
help it. I was feeling sick and was hurrying
to some place where I could lie down.”
</p>
<p>
The injured seaman did not answer at once.
</p>
<p>
“Is there anything I can do for you? May
I get you some water?”
</p>
<p>
“Go soak his head under the scuttle butt,”
shouted another sailor.
</p>
<p>
It was quite plain that, for some reason, all
hands seemed to enjoy Bill Kester’s unexpected
downfall, for no one expressed any sympathy
for him, or regret at the accident. This Sam
did not observe, however. He was too much
concerned over the result of his carelessness.
In fact he forgot, for the moment, that the deck
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>
was heaving under his feet and that everything
movable about him was on the move.
</p>
<p>
“Hit him again, red-head!”
</p>
<p>
“I said it was an accident, and that I am very,
very sorry. Did you understand?”
</p>
<p>
“You lie!”
</p>
<p>
Sam Hickey’s face had been pale since the
beginning of his recent internal disturbances.
But the color now surged to his cheeks, mounting
to the roots of his red hair, with which it merged.
</p>
<p>
“If you were not hurt, I’d make you take back
those words. I don’t allow any man to apply
that term to me.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s the talk. Hand him one for luck,
anyway, red-head!”
</p>
<p>
“You lie!” This time it came out with such
an accent that there was no misunderstanding.
Bill Kester’s intent was plainly to goad Sam
into attacking him.
</p>
<p>
The Battleship Boy stood with tightly
clenched fists at his side, his teeth grinding in
his great effort to control himself. Something
of this seemed to convey itself to the jackies who,
up to this moment, had looked upon the little
scene as a delightful diversion. They saw at
once that the red-headed, freckle-faced boy before
them was holding himself in check under
circumstances that would have driven any one
of them into a blind, uncontrollable rage.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>
</p>
<p>
“Coward!” shouted Kester.
</p>
<p>
At the same time he sprang forward, landing
a resounding slap on Sam Hickey’s cheek.
</p>
<p>
Smack!
</p>
<p>
The Battleship Boy’s right fist shot out. Sam
had gone the limit in self-control. He could
endure no more.
</p>
<p>
The fist landed squarely on Bill Kester’s sore
nose, but with a force that must have surprised
that worthy. The man staggered backward,
falling all in a heap, wedged in between the sides
of the eight-inch gun carriage.
</p>
<p>
“Whoop! Now let the eagle scream!”
shouted the sailors. “Pretty hot stuff for a
shipmate who’s on the binnacle list. Go over
and give him another on the same spot, red-head.”
</p>
<p>
Sam’s deck swab dropped from his hand.
</p>
<p>
“I’m sorry I did that. I ought not to have hit
him, but I just couldn’t help it.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you worry about that, lad,” soothed
a shipmate. “Bill got what was coming to him,
only you ought to hit him once more in the same
place. If you want to finish the job we’ll see
that you get fair play.”
</p>
<p>
“I do not want to fight. I am no fighter,”
said Sam.
</p>
<p>
“No fighter?” the sailors laughed uproariously.
“Do you know, red-head, that Bill Kester is a bully
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>
and that he’s licked half the crew
already?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t care if he has licked the whole fleet;
he can’t call me a liar and a coward. I could
stand for the liar business, because maybe he
didn’t mean it that way. But ‘coward’ I draw
the line at.”
</p>
<p>
By this time Kester had extricated himself
from his uncomfortable position. No one had
offered to help him, and for reasons of his own,
Sam had not gone to the fallen man’s assistance.
The lad stood calmly awaiting the result of his
act.
</p>
<p>
Bill got to his feet unsteadily, blinked his eyes,
gingerly felt his now flattened nose, then thrusting
out his chin, he glared at his young adversary.
</p>
<p>
Sam gave back the look unflinchingly.
</p>
<p>
“Shall we call it square? I’m sorry I tripped
you and sorry I had to hit you,” announced
Hickey in a manly tone, wholly free from anger.
</p>
<p>
For an instant Kester hesitated.
</p>
<p>
“All right; shake, shipmate,” he said, advancing.
</p>
<p>
Sam met him half way with a pleased smile
on his face, his right hand extended to complete
the truce that had been declared.
</p>
<p>
“Look out, red-head!” warned a voice with
a trace of excitement in it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>
</p>
<p>
The warning came too late.
</p>
<p>
Quick as a flash Bill Kester planted a cowardly
blow squarely between the boy’s eyes.
Sam Hickey settled down on the gun deck,
toppled over and straightened out.
</p>
<p>
For an instant there was silence. Then an
angry roar burst from the indignant jackies as
they made a concerted rush for Kester, who had
sought to follow up his advantage and inflict
further punishment on his victim while in this
defenseless position.
</p>
<h2><a name='chXIV' id='chXIV'></a>CHAPTER XIV—CALLED BEFORE THE MAST</h2>
<p>
“Steady, boys! Don’t maul him up,”
warned one of the cooler heads, as the
men started to take the punishment of
the bully into their own hands.
</p>
<p>
Kester was a man who was very much disliked
by his associates and shipmates. He was in
his second enlistment. He had once been dismissed
from the service, but, by means known
to none of his shipmates, had managed to get
back again.
</p>
<p>
“Throw him overboard! It’s all the cur deserves.”
</p>
<p>
“No; leave him for the kid to take care of.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes, leave him to me,” interrupted Sam,
raising himself on one elbow. “I’ll take care
of him when my head gets plumb on my shoulders
again. Did he hit me with a brick?”
</p>
<p>
Before replying, the jackies conducted Kester
to the forward bulkhead door. Through this
they thrust him, half a dozen heavy shoes landing
on him in swift kicks as he disappeared
through the door.
</p>
<p>
“What did you let him go for?” demanded
Hickey getting his feet, leaning against the butt
of a big gun for support. He was weak and
trembling, but not for an instant did his natural
grit desert him.
</p>
<p>
“That’s all right, shipmate. You ain’t in no
condition to mix it up with Bill. You wait till
some other time and you’ll get your chance and
it’ll be a fair and square knock-down fight, no
under the belt foul tactics either. You’re the
right kind, and we’re with you, even if you have
got a combustible head of hair on you, and that
stands all the time.”
</p>
<p>
Sam took his way forward thoughtfully. He
was still suffering from his illness and, besides,
was weak from the effects of the blow he had
received from Bill Kester.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, Kester, holding a handkerchief
to his face, was making his way toward
the surgeon’s quarters. His face was in sad
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>
need of repair, but he sought to hide that fact
from his associates.
</p>
<p>
“Hello, Bill, what’s the matter? Have an
argument with somebody?” greeted a shipmate,
with a quizzical squint at the bully’s face.
</p>
<p>
“I ran into a stanchion,” explained Kester
lamely, proceeding on his way, avoiding the
curiosity of the men as much as possible.
</p>
<p>
The surgeon, the instant he had taken a look
at the man’s face, however, saw that something
more than a stanchion had hit Bill on the nose.
All his questions, however, were avoided. On
his report to the captain, which the surgeon
made every night, was the notation: “Bill
Kester, seaman, badly battered face, broken
nose, with a deep gash in it, evidently made by
some sharp instrument. This man has been undoubtedly
in a bloody fight.”
</p>
<p>
That was all, but it was quite sufficient to
start the wheels of discipline moving. That
evening Kester was called upon by the master-at-arms.
</p>
<p>
“Kester, I have come to ask you with whom
you were in a fight to-day?”
</p>
<p>
“How’d you know I was in a fight?” demanded
the seaman in a surly tone.
</p>
<p>
“Your face answers that question. Who was
it?”
</p>
<p>
“Hickey.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>
</p>
<p>
“The recruit?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
There was a quizzical look in the eyes of the
master-at-arms. That a bully of Kester’s reputation
should have been used up in this manner
by a raw recruit was somewhat of a surprise
to him.
</p>
<p>
“What did he hit you with?”
</p>
<p>
Bill hesitated.
</p>
<p>
“What did he hit you with?”
</p>
<p>
“A deck swab.”
</p>
<p>
“And you nagged him to it?”
</p>
<p>
“No, I didn’t. I didn’t do anything till I
got it.”
</p>
<p>
“Very well. Do you wish to make a charge
against the man?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
There was no further investigation that night.
The master-at-arms’ report was made to the captain.
But that night Sam recounted to his
companion, Dan Davis, all that had occurred.
Dan listened attentively, asking a question now
and then.
</p>
<p>
“I do not see how you could have acted differently
unless you had run away, and I
shouldn’t want to think you had done such a
thing. I would much rather see you punished
than to know you had acted the part of a coward.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>
</p>
<p>
“Don’t use that word,” begged Sam. “Kester
did. That was what clinched the whole
business. If he hadn’t done that, I might not
have hit him, even though he slapped me.”
</p>
<p>
A dull flush suffused the cheeks of the Battleship
Boy at the memory of what had occurred,
but his voice was calm and without the slightest
emotion.
</p>
<p>
“Do you think there will be a row about it?”
he asked.
</p>
<p>
“I hope not. If there is, take your medicine
like a man,” advised Dan.
</p>
<p>
“I will. I’m feeling better now. I guess I
needed a good shaking up to jar the seasickness
out of me. I haven’t that ‘went-away’ feeling
now.”
</p>
<p>
“I guess you must mean a ‘gone’ feeling,
do you not?” smiled Dan.
</p>
<p>
“Yes; I was gone, all right.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, don’t worry about it. Nothing may
happen as the result of your fight.”
</p>
<p>
“Fight? Do you call that a fight? It wasn’t
a fight. If I had been feeling right there might
have been a fight. There may be yet. I have
an idea I have not heard the last of Kester. If
he gives me half a chance I’m going to pay
him back for that cowardly blow.”
</p>
<p>
“Be sure you are in the right, Sam,” cautioned
Dan. “Keep your head. Defend yourself, if you have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>
to, but see to it that you do
not stir up any trouble.”
</p>
<p>
Dan’s advice always was good, and Sam gave
more heed to it than he appeared to. As
a matter of fact, he set much store by the advice
and counsel of his cool-headed friend, Dan
Davis.
</p>
<p>
That evening passed uneventfully and the
lads enjoyed a refreshing night, with the cool
breezes from the sea blowing over their swaying
hammocks.
</p>
<p>
On the following morning after breakfast the
master-at-arms tapped Sam on the shoulder.
</p>
<p>
“You will report at mast on the quarter-deck
at one o’clock, sharp,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“Mast?” wondered Sam.
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“What for?”
</p>
<p>
“A charge has been laid against you.”
</p>
<p>
“What sort of charge?”
</p>
<p>
“Assaulting a shipmate and beating him.”
</p>
<p>
Sam uttered a short, nervous laugh.
</p>
<p>
“Is that all?”
</p>
<p>
“You will find it is quite enough. At a
quarter to one you will report forward of the
after twelve-inch-gun turret and there await
me. I shall bring other prisoners there for
trial. We will join you there.”
</p>
<p>
“Very well,” answered Sam. He did not yet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span>
realize the seriousness of the courteously executed
order. However, he looked up Dan as
soon thereafter as possible, relating to him what
had occurred.
</p>
<p>
“Why, Sam, you are under arrest!” exclaimed
Dan.
</p>
<p>
“Under arrest?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course you are.”
</p>
<p>
“But I thought they locked people up after
they arrested them.”
</p>
<p>
“It isn’t always necessary on shipboard.
You couldn’t get away if you wanted to.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s so. I hadn’t thought of it in that
light before. Under arrest? I wonder what
will happen to me next? First, I get seasick,
get knocked out, then get arrested for being
punched. This is a funny business. And the
worst of it is that I can’t change my mind for
four years.” Sam grinned a mirthless grin.
“Hard luck, isn’t it, Dan?”
</p>
<p>
“No; it is a good thing. All this will make
a man of you—of both of us.”
</p>
<p>
The lads went about their duties soon after
that. At noon Sam hurried through his dinner,
after which he slicked himself up as best
he could and went to the after gun turret, where
he awaited the master-at-arms, as he had been
ordered to do. The latter arrived a moment
later, bringing with him two other prisoners and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>
Bill Kester. The latter was accompanied by the
surgeon. Kester’s face—that is his nose—was
patched up with numerous strips of adhesive
plaster.
</p>
<p>
The men were conducted half way down the
deck, where stood the captain, the executive
officer of the ship and the captain’s yeoman,
the latter with his record book in hand, eyeing
them carefully.
</p>
<p>
“Sam Hickey, step forward,” called the yeoman.
</p>
<p>
The lad took his place in front of the captain,
who, at the moment, was studying the record
sheet giving Sam’s history.
</p>
<p>
“Where is the man who makes this charge?”
demanded the captain.
</p>
<p>
Kester was thrust forward by the master-at-arms.
</p>
<p>
“State your case,” commanded the captain.
</p>
<p>
“I was standing on the gun deck, facing forward,
sir, when this man Hickey comes along
and hits me with the deck swab.”
</p>
<p>
“He hit you with the deck swab?”
</p>
<p>
“With the handle, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Where did he hit you?”
</p>
<p>
“On the gun deck, sir, aft the eight-inch
gun.”
</p>
<p>
“I should say by your appearance that you
had been hit on the nose instead of on the gun
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>
deck,” replied the captain, without the suspicion
of a smile on his face.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir, he hit me on the nose, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“How could he do that when your back was
turned toward him?” demanded the captain
sharply.
</p>
<p>
“Somebody cried, ‘Look out,’ and I turned,
sir. Then I got it.”
</p>
<p>
“What did you do?”
</p>
<p>
“I slapped his face, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“And what did the prisoner do?”
</p>
<p>
Sam’s lips contracted a little upon his being
referred to as “the prisoner.”
</p>
<p>
“He hit me on the nose with his fist, right
on the sore spot, sir. He knocked me clean off
my feet, tumbling me up under the breech of
the eight-inch, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Then what happened?”
</p>
<p>
“I went to the surgeon, sir, to get myself fixed
up.”
</p>
<p>
“You were not the aggressor in any way?”
</p>
<p>
“Sir?”
</p>
<p>
“You are quite sure you did not start the
trouble?”
</p>
<p>
“How could I, when my back was turned,
sir?”
</p>
<p>
“I did not ask you that; I asked you whether
you were or not. Answer yes or no.”
</p>
<p>
“No, sir.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>
</p>
<p>
“That will be all for the present. Samuel
Hickey, step forward.”
</p>
<p>
The Battleship Boy moved three paces to the
front, looking the commanding officer squarely
but respectfully in the eyes.
</p>
<p>
“You have heard Kester’s story. What have
you to add to it, if anything?”
</p>
<p>
“I hardly think the story will stand any more
adding to, sir,” replied the boy, with a faint
smile. The captain appeared not to notice the
subtle fling in Sam’s answer.
</p>
<p>
“You will tell me, in as few words as possible,
how the row started.”
</p>
<p>
“We had finished scrubbing decks, sir. I
had been seasick and was going forward on a
run, carrying my deck swab. Somehow it
caught this man between the legs and upset him,
sir.”
</p>
<p>
“How did he get the wound on his nose, if
that is true?”
</p>
<p>
“He must have hurt himself in falling.”
</p>
<p>
The explanation sounded very lame to all who
heard it, though, as the reader knows, it was
wholly within the facts.
</p>
<p>
“You mean to tell me you did not strike him
at all?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes, sir, I struck him. I hit him as hard
as I could.”
</p>
<p>
“Where did you hit him?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>
</p>
<p>
“Plumb on the nose, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“What excuse have you to offer for assaulting
a man who already, according to your own
admission, was injured?”
</p>
<p>
“He called me a liar, sir; then afterwards he
called me a coward. I couldn’t stand that, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Is that all?”
</p>
<p>
“I think so, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, why doesn’t he tell the captain about
Kester’s having knocked him down,” groaned
Dan, who had, from a prudent distance, been
an interested listener to the examination.
</p>
<p>
“You have admitted that you struck the
man; you have admitted that you inflicted the
wound which, it appears, is of more than ordinary
seriousness, as it may cause his disfigurement
for life.”
</p>
<p>
Sam made no reply to this. None seemed to
be called for under the circumstances. Somehow
he felt that he had made out a very bad
case for himself. He had told nothing but the
truth, and not all of that, so far as his own vindication
went, and yet he knew he had been
placed in a false light.
</p>
<p>
“I’m in wrong, but I’ve got no one except
myself to blame for it,” thought Sam.
</p>
<p>
The captain consulted with his executive officer
for a moment. Then turning to the prisoner
he said, gravely:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span>
</p>
<p>
“Hickey, you are guilty of a very serious
breach of discipline. You are a new man on
board ship. Were it not for that fact I should
be much more severe. I am inclined to be
lenient with you under the circumstances. You
will understand that punishments are wholly
impersonal. They are punishments because
some rule has been violated. Discipline must
be maintained.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir,” answered Sam meekly.
</p>
<p>
“Silence!” warned the master-at-arms.
</p>
<p>
“I hope you will not forget the lesson. Control
your temper. Unless you are able to manage
your own temper you will never be fit to
manage other men. You will have to conquer
yourself before you can look for promotion in
the service.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“You will be placed in the brig for two days,
on bread and water, with one full ration in the
middle of the second day. And, Kester!”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Your record in the past has not been any
too good. I trust I shall not hear of your getting
into further trouble. You have been long
enough in the service to know how to keep out
of mischief.”
</p>
<p>
The captain motioned to the master-at-arms
to remove the prisoner.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>
</p>
<p>
Sam Hickey, with head erect, saluted his
superior officers, faced about, marching steadily
ahead of the master-at-arms, on his way to
be punished for an offense that he felt sure he
had not committed.
</p>
<p>
“I wish I’d hit Kester harder, while I was
about it,” Hickey muttered.
</p>
<p>
“I’m sorry, lad, but discipline is discipline,”
remarked the petty officer as he clanged the
door of the brig on Hickey.
</p>
<p>
“It’s all right, Mr. Master-at-Arms. There’s
one consolation; I don’t have to scrub decks
for the next two days, anyway. That’s some
relief.”
</p>
<p>
Sam threw himself down on the steel floor,
where he promptly went to sleep.
</p>
<h2><a name='chXV' id='chXV'></a>CHAPTER XV—A BAD BANGED-UP BULLY</h2>
<p>
“Oh, why didn’t he tell the captain that
Kester had knocked him down,” muttered
Dan. “I tried to signal Sam,
but he would not even look at me, so interested
was he in what was going on. They never would
have held him had they known the truth.”
</p>
<p>
The lad went about his duties in a thoughtful
mood that afternoon.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span>
</p>
<p>
Dan, by his close attention to duty, his manly
bearing, his enthusiasm, had attracted the attention
of his superiors. Their eyes were frequently
upon him, which was a distinct gain
for Dan, in view of the fact that the battleship’s
crew consisted of nearly eight hundred men
beside her forty officers.
</p>
<p>
Dan did not know that he was being observed,
nor would it have affected his conduct in the
least had he known it. He had made up his mind
to be an officer some day. He felt confident that
this great thing would come to pass. But the
goal seemed a long way off at the moment, when,
with paint brush in hand, he painted and painted
from morning until night, varying his occupation
late in the day by grabbing up his deck
swab, and, in bare feet, joining the deck division
in scrubbing down decks.
</p>
<p>
Being a sailor by instinct, the Battleship Boy
did not consider any work that he had been
ordered to do beneath him.
</p>
<p>
At sunset, that night, the bugle blew for
“colors,” meaning the formalities always observed
in lowering the Flag at sunset when the
ship was at anchor. This was the first time Dan
had had an opportunity to see “colors” since
he came aboard, for the ship had been under
way constantly.
</p>
<p>
A few moments before the sunset hour the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>
different divisions marched aft to the quarter-deck,
each division in charge of a midshipman
or an ensign. Coming to a halt, the divisions
faced midships, banked on each side of the
quarter-deck.
</p>
<p>
Grouped aft on the starboard side was the
band. In the center stood the captain, with his
executive officer, facing the Flag, and with the
marines drawn up just back of the jackies.
</p>
<p>
A deep silence pervaded the deck.
</p>
<p>
“Attention!”
</p>
<p>
The Flag slowly fluttered toward the deck,
every face being turned toward the stern, every
eye fixed on the Flag as it crept slowly downward.
</p>
<p>
As the Flag reached the deck the band struck
up “The Star-Spangled Banner.” The heart
of every jackie on the quarter-deck swelled with
patriotism, the strains of the national anthem
bringing a deeper color to the rows of tanned,
manly faces lined up in solid ranks on the
quarter-deck of the battleship “Long Island.”
</p>
<p>
“Attention! First division right face. Forward,
march!”
</p>
<p>
To the rhythmic tap of the drum the ship’s
company began marching from the deck in
steady lines, one division following another, until
all had disappeared save a group of officers
who stood chatting on the quarter-deck.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span>
</p>
<p>
The day’s work was practically done for all
except those who were on watch duty. All
hands repaired to the evening mess, and for an
hour there was quietness on board ship.
</p>
<p>
Dan asked permission to visit his companion
in the brig that evening. The permission was
abruptly refused. During the rest of the evening
the lad was unusually silent, and as soon
as hammocks were piped up, he hurried off to
bed, but not to sleep, for his thoughts were with
Hickey down in the brig. Had he but known,
there was little cause for worry. Sam was
not fretting, but was sound asleep on his
hard bed.
</p>
<p>
On the following morning, during the hour
when the smoke lamp was lighted, Dan was
pacing the forward deck. His righteous indignation
over the wrong that had been done his
chum was welling up within him until it momentarily
threatened to overmaster him, resulting
in some act that would bring punishment
on himself as well.
</p>
<p>
Kester had risen from where he had been
lounging on deck smoking his pipe. Dan had
not observed him. The lad was too fully occupied
with his own thoughts to give heed to
what was going on about him.
</p>
<p>
All at once he became aware that some one
was speaking to him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>
</p>
<p>
“How’s your red-headed friend this morning?”
</p>
<p>
Dan glanced up quickly, to find himself face
to face with Bill Kester.
</p>
<p>
He eyed the bully with a steady gaze.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t want to speak to me, eh?”
</p>
<p>
“No. I shall be very much obliged if you
will keep away from me. If you don’t, I am
afraid I shall forget myself.”
</p>
<p>
Kester laughed long and loud.
</p>
<p>
“Forget yourself! Ho, ho, ho! That’s a
joke—the funniest thing I ever heard. You
think you can bluff Bill Kester, do you?”
</p>
<p>
“I never bluff.”
</p>
<p>
“You’d better not.”
</p>
<p>
Dan clenched his fists, but started to move
away. He dared trust himself no further, for
his wrath was rising to the danger point, yet
there was nothing in his calm manner to indicate
that such was the case.
</p>
<p>
Kester stepped in front of him.
</p>
<p>
“See here, you landlubber, them high and
mighty airs don’t go down with me, and you’ll
find they don’t. You’ve got a few things to
learn on shipboard——”
</p>
<p>
“I shall have to find some one else to teach
me, if I have,” retorted Dan sharply.
</p>
<p>
By this time other eyes had been attracted
to them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>
</p>
<p>
“I reckon Bill is trying to pick a row with
Davis,” said one.
</p>
<p>
“Let them go. It will do the boy good to
get a trimming.”
</p>
<p>
Kester’s eyes narrowed.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, you will, eh?”
</p>
<p>
“That is what I said. Do you wish me to repeat
it? I will do so, if your hearing is not
good.”
</p>
<p>
“I said, how’s your red-headed friend this
morning?” growled the bully, his chin protruding
pugnaciously.
</p>
<p>
“Ask the master-at-arms if you wish to know.
I am not obliged to answer your questions.
There is no use in trying to be courteous with
you. You wouldn’t understand it at all.”
</p>
<p>
“You take that back, or——”
</p>
<p>
“Look here, Kester,” hinted Dan, a new light
appearing in his eyes. “Red-head, as you call
him, may be easy, but don’t monkey with
DYNAMITE. That’s all I’ve got to say to
you.”
</p>
<p>
“You throw it at me, do you? What you
need is a good licking, and that’s what you’re
going to get. I’ll run both you landlubbers out
of the service. I’ll trim your jib right now and
make the job complete.”
</p>
<p>
Dan gazed at him calmly, and as he stood
there facing the big man the Battleship Boy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>
appeared almost frail beside the other and more
powerfully built man.
</p>
<p>
“What is it that you propose to do? Don’t
keep me waiting. I have things of more importance
to attend to.”
</p>
<p>
Kester took one step forward, making a sudden,
vicious pass at Dan Davis’s head. He followed
it quickly with another blow with the
left hand.
</p>
<p>
By this time several jackies had started up.
</p>
<p>
“Quit it, Bill. Can’t you pick somebody of
your own size to fight with? If you can’t we’ll
do the job for you. We’ll——”
</p>
<p>
The speaker paused suddenly. All at once
things began to happen that caused them to
pause in open-mouthed wonder.
</p>
<p>
Both the bully’s blows had landed on thin
air. Davis had deftly side-stepped out of
harm’s way. The lad paused for one brief instant,
poising on his toes, then he leaped straight
at the husky sailor.
</p>
<p>
The men said afterwards that they could not
tell which was Bill and which was Dan Davis.
The air was full of flying fists, and above the
shouts of the sailors was heard the sound of
heavy blows.
</p>
<p>
The jackies yelled and shouted their appreciation.
Such a lively set-to they had not seen in
many a day.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>
</p>
<p>
At at once Bill Kester sat down on the deck
with a resounding bump, while Dan Davis stood
with a calm smile on his face, gazing down at
the astonished bully.
</p>
<p>
Then the sailors discovered that which set
them wild with enthusiasm. Both of Kester’s
eyes were blackened and rapidly swelling, and
were almost shut. His lips were puffed out to
twice their natural size and on the right side of
his head he wore a “beautiful” cauliflower ear.
</p>
<p>
Bill was dazed. He had been through many
hard-fought battles, but never had he quite met
with as sure and quick disaster as in the present
instance.
</p>
<p>
“I—I’ll fix you for this,” he snarled, getting
to his feet, groping for the companionway,
which he could not see, for by this time his eyes
were shut by the swelling.
</p>
<p>
“Why not do it now!” suggested Dan.
“There is no time like the present, and besides
we may not get another chance.”
</p>
<p>
“I can’t see, or I’d——”
</p>
<p>
“Let me help you.”
</p>
<p>
To the amazement of the delighted jackies,
Dan took the bully by the arm and courteously
assisted him to the gun deck.
</p>
<p>
“Here, you men,” he said. “Help Bill down
to the sick bay. He’s just bumped into something
hard.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>
</p>
<p>
Dan returned to the deck, where the sailors
crowded about him to congratulate him, but
Dan would have none of it. He got at his work
as soon thereafter as possible, but he felt sure
there would be trouble—that he would be disciplined
for his action.
</p>
<p>
“Anyway, I’ve got even for that blow he
gave Sam,” muttered the lad.
</p>
<p>
He was right in his surmise. Trouble did
follow. Both Bill Kester and Dan Davis were
called before the mast at one o’clock that afternoon.
</p>
<p>
This time there were several witnesses, all
of whom had volunteered to testify in behalf of
the Battleship Boy. There were three petty
officers among the number, and, to Dan’s surprise,
two commissioned officers who had
chanced to see the whole thing. Each assured
the captain that Davis had acted purely in self-defense.
</p>
<p>
The captain consulted Kester’s record and
nodded his head.
</p>
<p>
“I sentence you to three days in the brig on
bread and water, with no full rations during
that time,” announced the captain. “The next
time I will make it thirty days.”
</p>
<p>
“Davis,” he continued, turning to Dan, “I
am fully satisfied that you acted wholly in self-defense.
No marks will be placed against you.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span>
</p>
<p>
Secretly the captain was well pleased that
the bully had gotten such a sound drubbing.
The man’s face was a sight. The plasters over
the nose plainly located the spot where Sam
Hickey’s fists had landed, while the eyes, lips
and “cauliflower” ear testified to the power of
Dan Davis’s muscular punches.
</p>
<p>
“Remember, however, Davis, that fighting is
discouraged aboard ship. Fighting will be severely
dealt with in all instances. Providing
a man is acting in self-defense, with no fault on
his own part, that fact will be considered in
passing upon any disturbance that he may become
involved in. You understand thoroughly,
do you not!”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir,” answered Dan, saluting.
</p>
<p>
“You are a new man. Be guided wholly by
your officers. When in doubt consult them.”
</p>
<p>
Kester was led away to the brig to serve his
sentence. Sam heard them coming along the
corridor. Stepping to the door of his cell he
peered out through the grating. A grin spread
over his face as he caught sight of the woebegone
figure of Kester.
</p>
<p>
“Hello, Bill,” he jeered. “Who have you
been thumping?”
</p>
<p>
The bully made no reply, and a moment later
the cell door clanged behind him.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span><a name='chXVI' id='chXVI'></a>CHAPTER XVI—RECEIVING A CHALLENGE</h2>
<p>
“No mine drill to-day,” sang out a boatswain’s
mate, as he passed along the
forecastle. “Water too rough. If the
weather quiets down, however, there may be
something else doing.”
</p>
<p>
Instead of a day in the small boats laying
mines, as had been planned, the men were to have
another field day, painting ship, after the decks
had been scrubbed down. Gun crews got out
their pots and brushes, then crawled through the
narrow openings into the gun-turrets, first having
thrown open the hatches on top of the turrets,
to let in enough light to enable them to see
where to paint.
</p>
<p>
Walls were painted white, floors red, jackies
both red and white. Dan and Sam—the latter
having been released from the brig after serving
his sentence—not belonging to a gun crew, were
put to work in a corridor on this occasion. They
were in great good humor, having gained the
distinction of being ordered to report for wig-wag
signal duty during the mine practice, both
being experts with the signal flag. The boys
were talking over their good fortune when the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>
captain came hurrying through. Instantly the
boys came to attention.
</p>
<p>
“Good morning, lads,” greeted the commanding
officer.
</p>
<p>
“Fresh paint beside you, sir,” warned Dan.
</p>
<p>
“Very careless of me not to have observed it.
I see I have gathered quite a quantity of it already,”
he added, examining his trim braided
blouse that was now streaked with white.
</p>
<p>
“May I speak, sir?” asked Dan.
</p>
<p>
“Certainly, my lad. What is it?”
</p>
<p>
“Let me rub the paint off while it is still
fresh?”
</p>
<p>
“How?”
</p>
<p>
“This way, sir.”
</p>
<p>
Dan examined the sleeve of his jacket critically.
Having found a clean place he approached
the captain and began rubbing his
own sleeve over the soiled spot on the sleeve of
the commanding officer. This done he went at
the left side of the blouse where there was a
larger blotch of white. In a few moments he
had so thoroughly cleaned the blue blouse, by
rubbing it violently with the goods of his jacket,
that all traces of the white paint had disappeared.
</p>
<p>
Dan stepped back, saluting respectfully.
</p>
<p>
“Why, you have taken it all off, but you will
have the trouble of cleaning your own jacket.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>
</p>
<p>
“I shall have to do that anyway, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you, my lad.”
</p>
<p>
The captain saluted and passed on.
</p>
<p>
“That boy is as graceful and self-possessed as
if he had spent years in the service. I must
keep my eye on him. I predict that he will be
doing something worth while some of these
days.”
</p>
<p>
Dan’s face was flushed. He was pleased with
himself. Sam glanced over at him and winked
gravely.
</p>
<p>
“I wish I knew how to do things the way you
do,” he said. “Somehow my feet and hands
don’t fit the rest of my anatomy. I’m a thickhead
and a landlubber, all in one.”
</p>
<p>
“You are all right, if you would only think
so,” replied Dan.
</p>
<p>
After the noonday mess the boys were resting
on the forward deck when Sam called the attention
of his companion to a group of sailors
on the port side, leaning against the rail engaged
in earnest conversation. The spokesman
was no other than Bill Kester. Bill was gesticulating.
A sailor appeared to be opposing him
in something.
</p>
<p>
“I wonder what’s up?” mused Dan.
</p>
<p>
“Quarreling again, I guess,” decided Sam,
rising and strolling forward where he leaned
over the bow of the ship, gazing thoughtfully
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>
down into the turbulent sea. Now and then a
thin shower of spray would mount high in the
air and dash over him, the anchored ship having
swung about until its bow was headed into
the half-gale that was blowing up the coast.
</p>
<p>
After a time two jackies strolled over to where
Dan was sitting, and leaned indolently against
the forward twelve-inch turret.
</p>
<p>
“How’s the shipmate to-day?” inquired one.
</p>
<p>
“Very well, thank you.”
</p>
<p>
“Feeling fit as a fiddle, eh?”
</p>
<p>
“Never better, though I do feel as if I had
been eating paint all my life. I’m all red on
the outside and white on the inside. My walls
do not need any more dressing,” laughed Dan.
</p>
<p>
“Then we’ve got a proposition to make to
you.”
</p>
<p>
“A what?”
</p>
<p>
“Proposition.”
</p>
<p>
“What is it?”
</p>
<p>
“It’s usual on shipboard, when one party gets
a grouch on against another, to meet according
to rules and fight it out.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, what of it?”
</p>
<p>
“How’d you like to fight, matey?”
</p>
<p>
“No, thank you,” Dan replied, with considerable
emphasis, the memory of his previous
trouble still being fresh in mind. “Whom do
you want me to fight?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span>
</p>
<p>
“We haven’t said we wanted you to fight anybody.
We ain’t very strong on having you fight
somebody. Somebody wants to fight you, and
we’ve been appointed a committee to come over
and consult with you.”
</p>
<p>
“Some one wishes to fight me, is that it?”
questioned Dan.
</p>
<p>
“That’s about it, shipmate.”
</p>
<p>
Dan gazed at them inquiringly.
</p>
<p>
“Who?”
</p>
<p>
“Bill Kester.”
</p>
<p>
“I might have known it.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s only fair to tell you, Mr. Dynamite, that
he’s about the scrappiest scrapper on board the
‘Long Island.’ We’ve been thinking of getting
one of the men from aboard the ‘Michigan’ to
come over and whale the daylights out of him
some of these days. He’s got to get it before
he’ll quit picking trouble with other folks.
You’re under-size and lighter than Bill, even if
you did lay him out the other day. But because
of your size you’ve got a right to refuse, if you
want to,” continued the sailor.
</p>
<p>
It was plain, however, that he secretly hoped
Dan would accept the challenge to do battle with
the ship’s bully.
</p>
<p>
“No, boys, I have had one fight, though it
wasn’t much of a fight after all. You know
what happened? I was called before the mast
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>
and let go with a warning. Next time they
would put me ashore and tell me to go home. I
wish to stay in the service. When I fight, let it
be under the Flag I serve.”
</p>
<p>
“Nothing of the sort. Bill will be telling, all
over the ship, that you are afraid to meet him,
and maybe he’ll call you a coward. Of course
we fellows know you ain’t, Dynie.” (“Dynie,”
since Dan’s first outburst with Kester, had become
a favorite nickname for the boy.)
</p>
<p>
“He had better not,” Dan made answer in a
low, tense voice, a dull flush suffusing his cheeks.
“If he does that, I may be tempted to use a
marline spike on him.”
</p>
<p>
“Then you’d sure get out of the service,” replied
the sailor.
</p>
<p>
“You tell him to keep away and let me alone.
If he doesn’t I’ll defend myself, as I did before,
that is, if I can. I am not looking for
trouble, but I’ll face it if it comes.”
</p>
<p>
“Shall we tell him that?”
</p>
<p>
“Tell him by all means, if you think best. He
does not interest me at all.”
</p>
<p>
“You think it over, Dynie. We’ll talk with
you later. We’ll tell Bill something to satisfy
him till you make up your mind.”
</p>
<p>
“I have made up my mind. I won’t fight.”
</p>
<p>
The committee returned to the group, where
they talked for some moments, Dan observing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>
that Kester was scowling more ferociously than
usual and his voice rising higher.
</p>
<p>
“He’s a quitter! He’s a coward!” exclaimed
Bill.
</p>
<p>
Dan rose hastily and walked away.
</p>
<p>
“Trouble seems to be getting right in my way.
If I don’t try to push it out of the way I fall
over it. What’s a fellow to do?”
</p>
<p>
“What’s wrong, Dan?” questioned Sam,
overtaking his companion at that moment. He
had observed Dan’s troubled face.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, nothing much. They want me to fight
that fellow Kester.”
</p>
<p>
“Have they told you so?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“When?”
</p>
<p>
“Just now. Two of the boys came to me to
ask if I would fight him.”
</p>
<p>
“What did you say?”
</p>
<p>
“I told them I wouldn’t do it, unless he forced
me to do so in self-defense, and that then I’d
use a marline spike on him.”
</p>
<p>
Sam shook his head thoughtfully.
</p>
<p>
“It doesn’t seem to surprise you any,” complained
Dan.
</p>
<p>
“No, I can’t say that it does. I had suspected
something of the sort was in the wind. Are
you afraid of him, Dan?”
</p>
<p>
“Afraid of him?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“No, I am not afraid of him,” answered the
lad in a quiet voice. “But I have had my little
lesson through your fate, you know. Bread
and water don’t agree with my digestive organs.
Why, what do you think would happen to
me were I to get mixed up in that sort of
a row?”
</p>
<p>
“Nothing.”
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean?”
</p>
<p>
“I hear that when men on board these ships
have a misunderstanding, they are permitted to
fight it out under proper conditions.”
</p>
<p>
“They do?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. But the battles, I have heard, don’t
amount to much. The fighters are provided
with boxing gloves and the fight is more of a
boxing match than a battle. When it has gone
far enough it is stopped, the winner being the
one who has scored the most points. One of
the men was telling me about it. It isn’t very
different from the boxing matches you used to
take part in when we were in the High School,
is it?” suggested Sam.
</p>
<p>
“No,” answered Dan somewhat doubtfully.
“But this Kester is a loafer, and I do not like
to trust him. I am not timid, but I want to win
promotion in the service.”
</p>
<p>
“The others will see that you have fair play.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span>
</p>
<p>
“You advise me to meet him then?” questioned Dan.
</p>
<p>
“Of course I do. I wish he had challenged
me to fight him. I owe him one.”
</p>
<p>
“I am surprised at you, Sam. You forget
you have recently been in trouble for fighting
and now you turn around and urge me to go in
for a bout with a fellow who intends to knock my
head off if he is able to do it.”
</p>
<p>
“Not a fight, a boxing match, Dynie,” grinned
Sam.
</p>
<p>
Dan laughed.
</p>
<p>
“A nice gentlemanly, hand-shaking sort of a
bout, eh? Well I’ll see.”
</p>
<p>
“Are you going to meet him?”
</p>
<p>
“I will let you know in a few minutes whether
I shall or not.”
</p>
<p>
“What are you going to do?”
</p>
<p>
“Find out where I am at first,” answered Dan,
turning away and hurrying below. He went directly
to the quarters of the boatswain’s mate,
and, after calling out his own name at the door,
was told to enter.
</p>
<p>
“What is it, my lad?”
</p>
<p>
Dan briefly related the story of the proposition
that had been made to him to fight Kester.
The mate listened gravely until he had finished.
</p>
<p>
“Well, what are you going to do about it?”
</p>
<p>
“That is what I have come to ask you, sir.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>
You told us to consult you when we were in
doubt or needed advice.”
</p>
<p>
“I certainly did.”
</p>
<p>
“I am in need of advice right now—very
much in need of it, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“There is bad blood between you two, is there
not?”
</p>
<p>
“You might call it that. I cannot say that
I have any feeling either way. You know my
chum was sent to the brig for having a mix-up
with Kester. I might share the same fate.”
</p>
<p>
“Tell me the details of that trouble. I have
not heard the inside.”
</p>
<p>
Dan did so briefly.
</p>
<p>
“The coward!” muttered the boatswain’s
mate, upon hearing how Kester had knocked
Sam Hickey down. “Meet him, by all means.”
</p>
<p>
“But, sir, shall I not be disciplined for so
doing?”
</p>
<p>
“No, lad. Fighting, it is true, is severely punished
on board the ships of the Navy, but boxing
is encouraged. We are all fighting men; therefore
we should all know how to fight, under
proper regulations. You will get fair play; the
men will see to that.”
</p>
<p>
“I think I shall be able to take care of myself,”
smiled Dan. “I want to be sure that I
shall not get into disgrace, that’s all.”
</p>
<p>
“No danger. But I do not like to see a boy so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>
young pitted against an experienced man like
Kester. It isn’t fair. However, if you are
greatly overmatched, the bout will be promptly
stopped. You will have shown your grit.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you very much. You have relieved
my mind.”
</p>
<p>
Dan made his way back to the forecastle
where he found Sam waiting for him.
</p>
<p>
“Well, how about it?”
</p>
<p>
“It’s all right. I will meet him if the
terms are satisfactory. Will you be my second,
Sam?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course. You do not have to ask that.
I’ll go consult Kester’s seconds now.”
</p>
<p>
Later on Sam rejoined his companion.
</p>
<p>
“How is it going to be carried off?” questioned
Dan.
</p>
<p>
“The men are going to pick out a referee.
You and Kester are to box with eight ounce
gloves until the referee stops you, or either of
you decide you have had enough. You will get a
fair show, the boys say. They won’t stand for
Bill’s punishing you brutally. They admire
your pluck in meeting him. If you could thrash
him, Dan Davis, I’d be willing to go to the brig
again, and feed on bread and water for a
month.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m lucky if I do not get there myself,”
grinned Dan. “When is it to take place?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>
</p>
<p>
“At seven bells this evening, half-past seven.
There goes the bugle. We must get at our painting
again.”
</p>
<h2><a name='chXVII' id='chXVII'></a>CHAPTER XVII—PROVING HIS COURAGE</h2>
<p>
The day continued rough, and, there being
no further hope of planting a mine field,
the work of cleaning ship was proceeded
with.
</p>
<p>
All hands forward were discussing the coming
battle—the evening’s fun. They knew they
would have it. None, however, doubted that
Kester, in a regular match, would prove too
much for his young adversary, Kester being the
hero of so many successful battles.
</p>
<p>
Those who had seen Dan handle the bully on
the forecastle, however, predicted that the Battleship
Boy would give a good account of himself,
though they agreed that Kester was much
the stronger man, and the more experienced of
the two.
</p>
<p>
As for Dan Davis, he appeared not to be
troubling himself in the least about the coming
battle. He went about his work cheerfully, ate
his usual supper and, while the smoke lamp was
lighted after supper, wandered about the forecastle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span>
chatting with his shipmates happily, without
once referring to the coming contest.
</p>
<p>
At a little after seven o’clock three jackies
began stretching a rope about a portion of the
deck on the starboard side, while two others were
rigging some electric lights over the spot.
</p>
<p>
Dan paused with hands behind his back,
watching the work curiously.
</p>
<p>
“You had better get ready,” suggested a tar.
“The thing comes off sharp at seven bells.”
</p>
<p>
“I have nothing to get ready.”
</p>
<p>
“You want to put on your fighting togs, don’t
you?”
</p>
<p>
“What fighting togs?”
</p>
<p>
“Your trunks.”
</p>
<p>
“No. I’ll box as I am. I don’t have to go in
like a professional pugilist.”
</p>
<p>
“You’ll be at a disadvantage, then.”
</p>
<p>
“That will be my lookout, thank you.”
</p>
<p>
Upon glancing about the lad observed that
there were no officers in sight. There was a
reason for that, though he did not know it. The
officers had been fully informed of what was to
take place that evening, and hence discreetly
kept away from the forecastle. However, there
was, unknown to the others, a commissioned officer
standing behind the weather cloth on the
navigator’s bridge.
</p>
<p>
The particular officer was an ensign, and when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>
the hour for the boxing match approached he
was joined by a brother officer. They peered
down on the active scene below with keen interest.
Being in a deep shadow they were unobserved
by the men on the forward deck.
</p>
<p>
Kester had not yet made his appearance, and
the jackies shook their heads as they saw Dan
strolling about, chatting and joking with a shipmate.
</p>
<p>
“That’s the fellow,” said one of the ensigns
to his companion, at the same time pointing to
Dan.
</p>
<p>
“Seems pretty light to match with a man of
Kester’s build, doesn’t he?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, that is what I think. The boy has a
steady eye, however. He seems a likely lad,
but of course he can’t win the match.”
</p>
<p>
“Wasn’t he up for something the other
day?”
</p>
<p>
“No, that was his friend, Hickey. The latter
got two days in the brig for a row with this
same Kester. I heard the captain saying, this
evening, that he doubted the boy’s being to
blame for that after all. He has heard something
since about that affair.”
</p>
<p>
“You aren’t worrying about it, are you?”
laughed his companion.
</p>
<p>
“Not particularly. I do not like to see injustice
done, just the same. I should not be fit
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>
to be an officer if I felt otherwise. There comes
the other one, now.”
</p>
<p>
“The fellow Kester?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
Bill Kester was clad in a pair of short trunks
and canvas shoes, with a red handkerchief about
his neck. He hopped into the ring, taking his
seat in a corner, having chosen the one that
suited him best.
</p>
<p>
A moment later the referee that the men had
chosen entered the ring.
</p>
<p>
“Davis!” he called sharply.
</p>
<p>
There was a movement outside the ring.
</p>
<p>
“Here,” answered Dan, pausing in his conversation
with a jackie.
</p>
<p>
“Get into the ring, if you are going to.”
</p>
<p>
Dan climbed through the ropes, smiled and
nodded to the referee, then stood awkwardly
twirling his white cap.
</p>
<p>
“Take your corner.”
</p>
<p>
The lad walked over and sat down. For the
first time, he observed the scowling Bill Kester
in the opposite corner, and Dan’s eyes took
on a gleam of amusement as he noted the strips
of plaster on his opponent’s nose, the swollen
lips and discolored eyes.
</p>
<p>
“Are you going to fight in that costume?” demanded
the referee of Dan.
</p>
<p>
“Certainly, unless there is objection.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>
</p>
<p>
“I know of none. Kester, do you object to
Davis’s boxing with his clothes on?”
</p>
<p>
Kester grinned and shook his head. Two
pairs of gloves were passed through the ropes
to the referee, who examined them inside and
out.
</p>
<p>
“Want to look at these, Bill?”
</p>
<p>
Bill did. He scrutinized them even more carefully
than had the referee before passing them
back.
</p>
<p>
“Davis, look them over,” said the referee,
turning to the boy’s corner.
</p>
<p>
“You say they are all right, do you not?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course.”
</p>
<p>
“Then why should I look at them? I am willing
to take your word, I guess.”
</p>
<p>
Nods of approval followed this announcement.
</p>
<p>
“Put on your gloves.”
</p>
<p>
Dan threw off his jacket, tossing it outside the
ropes, turned up his trousers then sat down, extending
his hands for the boxing gloves.
</p>
<p>
“The youngster either doesn’t know what he
is going up against, or else he has a lot of confidence
in himself,” muttered one of the officers
on the bridge.
</p>
<p>
Both men tried their gloves by opening and
closing their hands, after which they sat up,
glancing at the referee expectantly.
</p>
<p>
“This is to be a fair battle, mates,” began
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>
the referee. “The one who commits a foul
loses the match, and maybe he might get worse
if the foul is very foul. The rounds will be
three minutes each, with a minute’s wait between.
No striking in the clinches, but either
party is free to hit his opponent in the breakaway.
Do you both understand?”
</p>
<p>
The men nodded.
</p>
<p>
“I guess that’s about all, then. Are you
ready?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” answered Dan and Kester in chorus.
</p>
<p>
“Shake hands and begin.”
</p>
<p>
Bill Kester bounded to the center of the ring,
but Dan rose methodically. Stepping slowly
forward he extended his glove, grasping the
hand of his opponent. No sooner had the lad
dropped the hand than Kester launched a terrific
blow at the Battleship Boy’s head. It
missed by the narrowest margin. Dan felt the
glove brush his cheek ever so lightly, but he
had instinctively thrown his head to one side
as he realized that it was coming his way, thereby
escaping the blow.
</p>
<p>
He danced awkwardly back out of the way.
Kester sprang after him, aiming blow after
blow at the head of his slender antagonist. How
they missed knocking the boy out the spectators
were unable to say, but somehow the lad managed
to escape being hit, though his awkwardness made them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span>
groan in sheer sympathy for
him.
</p>
<p>
“It’s a shame. The boy doesn’t know how
to fight,” cried a voice.
</p>
<p>
“Let him alone. He’s got to learn some time.
One punch won’t hurt him. It will do him
good.”
</p>
<p>
Sam, however, shrewdly suspected the reason
for his companion’s poor showing. Dan was
nervous. Sam knew that it was not because of
the boy’s fear of the man before him. It was
rather the consciousness that so many eyes were
fixed upon him. It was a case of real stage
fright.
</p>
<p>
“I hope he gets over it before it is too late.
Brace up, Dan! What’s the matter with you,
anyway?”
</p>
<p>
Dan heard the voice of his chum, but it
sounded far away to him. He would have given
almost anything could he, too, have been far
away at that moment.
</p>
<p>
Bang!
</p>
<p>
The boy’s head was suddenly jolted backwards.
Dan seemed to have heard his neck
crack. He wondered if it were broken. Kester
had gotten through his guard, but the blow had
landed on Davis’s forehead. The boy sprang
back, now, stepping about more quickly and
skillfully, though his head swam dizzily. Bill
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>
made a rush at him. Escape seemed hopeless,
for Dan was standing back against the ropes.
</p>
<p>
Dan suddenly ducked, however, under a
powerful right-arm swing, and danced to the
center of the ring, at which the crowd yelled
and shouted their appreciation.
</p>
<p>
“That’s the way to do it. Now hand him
one!”
</p>
<p>
“Time!” called the referee. The round was
ended. The men retired to their corners, where
they were fanned and their faces bathed by
their seconds.
</p>
<p>
“Do something this time,” begged Sam.
“You are not half boxing. What is the matter
with you to-night?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know. I guess I needed that punch.
It made my head swim, but it woke me up.
I’ll do better this time.”
</p>
<p>
“Give him a punch in the plexus, Bill,” advised
one of the latter’s seconds. “He doesn’t
guard himself there at all.”
</p>
<p>
“Never mind. I’ve got the fellow’s measure,”
answered the bully. “It will all be finished
up and done to a turn before we end the
second round.”
</p>
<p>
“Time!” summoned the referee.
</p>
<p>
Kester sprang into the ring full of confidence,
but Dan, to the surprise of everyone, sat calmly
in his chair. Kester hesitated, a triumphant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>
gleam appearing in his eyes. Suddenly he made
a rush at his opponent’s corner, and all at once
the Battleship Boy leaped to his feet. His right
fist shot out and then his left. Both blows
landed squarely on his adversary’s sore nose,
bringing two plainly audible grunts from the
big man.
</p>
<p>
Kester threw one hand to his nose. As he
did so, Dan planted a swift, powerful blow,
this time in his adversary’s stomach. The force
of it sent Bill staggering half way across the
ring.
</p>
<p>
The spectators fairly yelled themselves hoarse.
</p>
<p>
“You’re all right, Dynamite! You’ll be a
champion some day, when you wake up.”
</p>
<p>
But Bill was boxing again. The blows on
his nose had enraged him beyond endurance.
With a yell of rage, he charged his slender
opponent, leading out his right for the lad’s
face. The latter blocked the blow, side-stepping
out of harm’s way, where he stood awaiting the
other man’s further efforts.
</p>
<p>
“Why don’t you follow him up?” shouted
Sam, who, by this time, was wildly excited.
His face was flushed, and his eyes were sparkling
with joy over his companion’s good showing
in this round.
</p>
<p>
Dan made no effort to follow Kester up. The
lad had his own ideas, and now he appeared
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>
to be fully aware of what he was doing and
what he hoped to do.
</p>
<p>
Kester came back, sparring cautiously. He
landed two light blows on the boy’s shoulder,
which Dan returned with right and left over
the heart. He seemed purposely not to have
put much force into the blows. He felt that he
had inflicted enough injury on his antagonist,
and hoped he should have to do so no more.
</p>
<p>
The spirit of battle had taken full possession
of Kester, however. He was determined to
knock his young opponent out. He was exerting
every effort to that end.
</p>
<p>
All at once, in a rapid exchange of blows,
the big man clinched, throwing his full weight
on Dan’s shoulders, with the evident intention
of tiring the boy out.
</p>
<p>
“Break!” cried the referee.
</p>
<p>
Kester dropped one hand to his side, the
other remaining on Dan’s shoulder. Like a
flash the big man’s right came up with a terrific
hook on the boy’s jaw. It laid Dan flat
on the floor some distance away.
</p>
<p>
“Foul!” roared the crowd. “He struck in
the clinch.”
</p>
<p>
“Time!” announced the referee. The three
minutes were ended.
</p>
<p>
“It’s a foul. Give the fight to the boy,”
shouted the jackies, jumping about excitedly,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>
with difficulty restraining themselves from leaping
into the ring and inflicting quick punishment
on the bully who had committed the foul.
</p>
<p>
Kester had taken his corner, but when he
saw the temper of the spectators he grew ill at
ease.
</p>
<p>
Dan, in the meantime, had been dragged to
his own corner by Hickey, who was now using
every effort to bring his companion back to
consciousness. This he soon succeeded in doing.
Though Dan was dizzy and trembling, he smiled
bravely.
</p>
<p>
“You win the fight on a foul,” announced
the referee.
</p>
<p>
Davis shook his head.
</p>
<p>
“You do not wish to claim the foul?”
</p>
<p>
“No; I could not think of it.”
</p>
<p>
“You wish to go on with the match?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, unless Kester is willing to call it a
draw.”
</p>
<p>
“Not much,” growled the bully. “We’ll
fight!”
</p>
<p>
“Good for you, Dan,” whispered Sam, while
the spectators were shouting their approval.
Even if Dan were defeated, now, the Battleship
Boy had won the admiration and respect of his
shipmates. He had established his reputation
on board the “Long Island” for all time for
bravery.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>
</p>
<p>
“I thought this was to be a boxing match,”
muttered Dan.
</p>
<p>
“It is.”
</p>
<p>
“I call it pretty close to a prize fight. That
was an awful wallop he gave me. I can feel it
yet.”
</p>
<p>
The call of “time” interrupted the conversation.
Once more the contestants faced each
other in the center of the ring. Dan still was
a bit unsteady on his feet as the result of the
blow that had knocked him down. He exhibited
not the slightest indication of excitement,
however, and though suffering great pain,
he was cool and calm, presenting a smiling face
to his adversary.
</p>
<p>
Kester suddenly rushed him and Dan rushed
Kester. They met with a bang, neither giving
ground to the other for several seconds. The
big man was the first to back away. Dan’s sole
object in life now appeared to be to land his
eight-ounce gloves on the unfortunate nose
of his antagonist. He played for the nose with
all the skill and cunning that he possessed. In
the meantime Bill was reaching wildly for the
younger man’s stomach, upon which he seemed
unable to land, and getting a bang on the
nose nearly every time he attempted it, much to
his disgust.
</p>

<p>
“We had better call it a draw now, had we
not?” begged Davis during a lull. “You’ve
had enough. I don’t want to hurt you more.”
</p>
<p>
“No!” bellowed Kester, enraged at the suggestion.
“Not till I’ve put you to sleep for the
rest of the night.”
</p>
<p>
“Then we had better end it right here. This
for Hickey—and this for me!”
</p>
<p>
The men said afterwards that they saw no
blows struck, but that they heard two distinct
impacts. What they did see was Kester hurled
clear across the ring, after two eight-ounce
gloves had landed on the very point of his jaw,
directed by all the strength of Dan Davis’s well-trained
muscles.
</p>
<p>
Kester went clear through the ropes.
</p>
<p>
“Catch him!” shouted Dan.
</p>
<p>
Others had discovered the defeated bully’s
danger. Half a dozen tars sprang to his rescue.
Already Bill Kester’s head and shoulders
were through the ship’s rope railing, and in
another second he would plunge headlong into
the sea.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span><a name='chXVIII' id='chXVIII'></a>CHAPTER XVIII—THE ORDERLY TAKES A HEADER</h2>
<p>
“He’s going overboard!” roared a chorus
of voices. “Nail him!”
</p>
<p>
They did “nail” him, but not a
second too soon, and Kester was hauled back
into the ring amid a great uproar. Dan was
standing in the center of the roped enclosure,
his face a bit more pale than usual, but in no
other way did he exhibit emotion. By this time
Sam was at his side, rapidly stripping the gloves
from the hands of the victor.
</p>
<p>
“It was great—the greatest fight I ever saw
in my life!” cried the red-headed boy excitedly.
</p>
<p>
“It was not. It was tough, but I had to do
it,” replied Dan moodily. “I just had to do it
to save myself. He would have given me a
terrible beating had I not finished him. I saw
that early, and tried to get him to call it a draw.
He refused, so there was nothing left for me
except to finish it right there. I am glad he
did not go overboard. That would have been
terrible. Is he still unconscious?”
</p>
<p>
“I have been too busy to look,” grinned Sam.
</p>
<p>
All at once the jackies seemed to have recovered
from their surprise.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>
</p>
<p>
“Dynamite! Dynamite!” they roared.
</p>
<p>
Making a concerted rush at the Battleship
Boy, they hoisted him to their shoulders and
began marching about the deck shouting and
singing, though Dan much preferred not to have
his victory celebrated in this manner. There
was no restraining the jackies, however. From
a raw recruit Dan Davis had, in a few moments,
won his way into the heart of every jackie, except
Kester, on board the “Long Island.” Dan
had suddenly grown from boyhood to manhood
in their estimation.
</p>
<p>
As soon as he could release himself from their
hospitable shoulders the lad made his way to
the ring, where Kester’s seconds had just succeeded
in restoring him to consciousness.
</p>
<p>
“I’m sorry, Kester. I hope I have not hurt
you,” said Dan in a tone of deep concern. To
this the fellow made no reply.
</p>
<p>
“Won’t you shake hands with me and let us
be friends?”
</p>
<p>
“No!”
</p>
<p>
“Bill, Bill, don’t be a grouch—don’t be a
sorehead. Dynie licked you fair and square,”
urged one of the man’s companions.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll even up with you for this, you—you
cub!”
</p>
<p>
Dan drew himself up proudly.
</p>
<p>
“Very well. I have tried to do the manly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>
thing. If you refuse to have it that way, it
surely is not my fault. But I give you fair
warning. Keep away and let me alone hereafter.
Until you are willing to make friends,
I want nothing more to do with you. When
you are, I shall be glad to meet you half way.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s the talk, Dynie,” chorused several
voices approvingly. “You had better not fool
with the fire any more, Bill. It burns. You
ain’t in the same class with that stick of dynamite.
He’s got you anchored with both port
and starboard anchors and the chains not half
out.”
</p>
<p>
“Please do not stir him up,” begged Dan. “I
am ashamed of myself for what I have done as it
is.”
</p>
<p>
“What? Ashamed for licking the ship’s
bully?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, ain’t that a joke, mates?”
</p>
<p>
The sailors laughed loudly. In the meantime,
Kester’s seconds had gotten him up, and were
helping him to a sheltered part of the superstructure,
where they assisted him to get into
his clothes. The big man was still very unsteady
on his feet, and his face was streaked
with blood from the unfortunate nose.
</p>
<p>
“You’ll have to go to Pills to get fixed up.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, my nose hurts.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>
</p>
<p>
Once more the surgeon was called upon to
dress Bill Kester’s face and bolster up the flattened
nose.
</p>
<p>
“You’ve been in a fight again, my man,”
rebuked the surgeon. “I shall have to make a
report of it to the captain. Who hit you!”
</p>
<p>
“Davis.”
</p>
<p>
“It will go hard with him, then,” muttered
the surgeon. “That young man must have an
awful punch.”
</p>
<p>
The surgeon’s report was duly made to the
captain. The latter called his executive officer
at once.
</p>
<p>
“See here, Coates, what’s this about Kester
having been in another fight?” he demanded
after the executive officer had responded to his
summons.
</p>
<p>
“It wasn’t a fight, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Not a fight?”
</p>
<p>
“No, sir. That is, it was a boxing match on
the forecastle. One of the regular set-tos. It
was all regular and proper, but it was pretty
rough, I understand.”
</p>
<p>
“Who did it?”
</p>
<p>
“Ordinary Seaman Davis.”
</p>
<p>
“The red-headed boy?”
</p>
<p>
“No, his friend.”
</p>
<p>
“You don’t mean to tell me that that slim
youngster put a man of Kester’s build in such
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>
shape that he had to report at sick bay, do
you?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, I thought Kester was known as a
bully?”
</p>
<p>
“He was, sir. He will not be any longer, I
imagine.”
</p>
<p>
The captain gazed at his executive officer;
then, leaning back in his chair, he laughed and
chuckled to himself for a full minute.
</p>
<p>
While fighting and brawling were sternly
suppressed on board the “Long Island,” the
commanding officer believed that fighting men
should be allowed to fight under proper conditions.
It had become an unwritten law on
board, therefore, that the jackies were to be
allowed to settle their difficulties with the
gloves, sparring under a referee and with no
brutality. This enabled the sailor lads to enjoy
many a fine sparring match on the forward
deck. In fact, bouts were put on regularly every
Saturday night. In doing this the men managed
occasionally to pit against each other men
who had a grudge to settle. This made the
sport more real.
</p>
<p>
Kester had demanded the match with Davis,
and the latter had no way to avoid the meeting
without laying himself open to a charge of
cowardice. Dan Davis was not a coward,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>
neither was he a bully. He wished to be let
alone, and he had gone into the fight with reluctance,
as the reader already knows. Now
that it was over, he was heartily ashamed of
himself for his part in the battle.
</p>
<p>
“Did any of our officers see the fight, Coates?”
asked the captain.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir. Ensigns Brant and Cockrill
watched it from the bridge. They tell me it
was perfectly regular. I made inquiry. They
say the recruit, Davis, put it over the big fellow
like a deck awning, though the young fellow
evidently was reluctant to fight.”
</p>
<p>
“I am glad to hear that.”
</p>
<p>
“I think Kester was to blame for the previous
trouble with the other boy.”
</p>
<p>
“No doubt. I shall make inquiry into that
matter as well. I want to make sure that that
fellow is trying to stir up trouble on board.
When I am certain we will give him a quick
trial and put him ashore one of these days.”
</p>
<p>
“You will take no official action on this last
fight, then?”
</p>
<p>
“Certainly not, since you say it was entirely
regular.”
</p>
<p>
“It was, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Then there is nothing mere to be said. Candidly,
between ourselves, Coates, I’m more
pleased than I know how to express that the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>
young fellow gave Kester a sound thrashing.
By the way, I should like to look that young
man over.”
</p>
<p>
“Very good, sir. Shall I send him to you?”
</p>
<p>
“No, not that way. I’ll tell you what you
had better do. Have both boys assigned as my
orderlies in turn. I want these new men to get
an early chance at orderly duty. It is a most
excellent thing for them. Send Hickey to-morrow.”
</p>
<p>
“Very good, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“I would rather have my own boys act as
my orderlies than have the marines do it.”
</p>
<p>
The captain’s orderly is supposed to stand
outside the captain’s door at all times while
the commanding officer is in his quarters. When
the captain moves to any other part of the ship
his orderly follows at a respectful distance, so
as to be on hand to carry orders and to perform
such other small duties as the captain may
command. It is considered an honor to be
chosen for the duty.
</p>
<p>
Soon after the finish of the fight Dan and
Sam hurried to their quarters to turn in. Sam
was chuckling over his companion’s great victory.
Dan surveyed him with disapproving
eyes.
</p>
<p>
“Dan, I have always looked upon you as a
nice, sisterly sort of a chum.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>
</p>
<p>
“Well?” questioned Dan, with a smile.
</p>
<p>
“You’re a bloodthirsty wretch, that’s what
you are. Good night.”
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
Late that night a full gale sprang up. Word
of the weather conditions was brought to the
captain.
</p>
<p>
“Heave up the anchors and get under way
at once,” was the command. “Tell the chief
engineer to get ready as soon as possible. How
many boilers are fired up?”
</p>
<p>
“Six, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Have the fires put under the other two at
once. We must put to sea and ride the gale
out there.”
</p>
<p>
The captain quickly dressed and hurried up
to the bridge. The spray was dashing clear
over the bridge, soaking everything and everyone
on it. In the meantime a boatswain’s mate
was bawling out his orders through the ship,
hurriedly turning out the various watches.
</p>
<p>
Dan and Sam were awakened by the heavy
rolling of the ship. Both sat up in their hammocks
at the same instant.
</p>
<p>
“What’s going on?” asked Dan as he heard
men hurrying along the decks to their stations.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe the ship is sinking,” suggested the
cheerful Sam.
</p>
<p>
“Nonsense!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>
</p>
<p>
“I’m going to get up, anyway.”
</p>
<p>
“You have no right to do so until you are
piped down. You will be called out if you are
wanted.”
</p>
<p>
“You mean to say that I can’t get up if I
want to?”
</p>
<p>
“Certainly not. You are supposed to stay
in your hammock and get your rest.”
</p>
<p>
“Not if the ship is sinking!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, that would be different. I guess we
would all be getting out in that event.”
</p>
<p>
“Huh!” muttered Sam, lying back in his
swaying hammock, listening to the wind whistling
through the cage masts far above them.
</p>
<p>
In a short time the ship was under way, moving
slowly as she headed out to sea. The storm
was in no sense dangerous to the ship’s welfare,
but it was safer to be out in the open until the
gale should have blown itself out.
</p>
<p>
When the men were piped out the next morning
the Battleship Boys found it difficult to keep
right side up. Dan was unaffected by the rolling
and plunging, but Sam had little appetite
for his breakfast.
</p>
<p>
The morning work having been finished Sam
was accosted by the master-at-arms.
</p>
<p>
“You will act as the captain’s orderly to-day,
Hickey,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“Orderly?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
Sam did not know whether to be glad or sorry.
</p>
<p>
“Just before eight bells go to your quarters
and put on your clean clothes. See that you are
ship-shape. I don’t know why the commanding
officer wants you.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you, sir. I report at eight bells?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“Where?”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll let you know. Wherever the captain
chances to be at that moment. Quite likely he
will be at his breakfast. He is on the bridge at
present.”
</p>
<p>
“What do you think of that, Dan?” demanded
Sam slowly, confiding to his companion the order
that had just been given to him.
</p>
<p>
“I think it fine. It looks as if you had gotten
into the captain’s good graces. I hope so. See
that you perform your duties in a ship-shape
manner. Keep your head working all the time.
I should call it almost a promotion.”
</p>
<p>
“I hope I don’t get seasick,” muttered Sam
doubtfully. “This rolling is awful.”
</p>
<p>
An hour later, Sam Hickey made his way
down the after gangway to the captain’s quarters,
clad in a spotless white uniform, his
braided white knife-lanyard drooping gracefully
across his chest and disappearing in the pocket
of the blouse.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>
</p>
<p>
“I’ve come to relieve you as the captain’s orderly,”
announced Sam to the marine, who was
acting in that capacity.
</p>
<p>
The orderly returned the nod and hurried
away, for he had not yet had his breakfast.
</p>
<p>
Sam braced himself against a wall in the corridor
with his eyes fixed on the swaying curtain
that shut off the room in which the captain
was breakfasting at that moment. The corridor
was narrow and close, and Sam soon grew
restive. Espying a chair a little way from him,
he helped himself to it and sat down, crossing
his legs.
</p>
<p>
Just then an officer came hurrying through
the corridor.
</p>
<p>
“See here, my man, what are you doing
there?” he demanded.
</p>
<p>
“Captain’s orderly, sir,” answered Sam, saluting.
</p>
<p>
“Get up! Don’t you know an orderly is supposed
to remain on his feet? Never sit down
when on duty. Stand at attention when the captain
comes out and remain that way until he has
passed. After that, follow him.”
</p>
<p>
“Aye, aye, sir.”
</p>
<p>
The Battleship Boy peered after the retreating
form of the officer.
</p>
<p>
“Seems to me they are mighty particular.
I’d like to be up where I could get some air. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>
wonder if I dare take a sneak to the deck for a
whiff?”
</p>
<p>
Sam did not get the chance just then. It was
well for him that he did not, for he would have
been severely punished for deserting his post
had he been discovered away from it. He
started as a sharp command came, from behind
the curtain.
</p>
<p>
“Ord’ly!”
</p>
<p>
“Who’s calling, I wonder?” muttered the boy.
</p>
<p>
“Ord’ly!” This time the command was
given in a more imperative tone.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll bet that is the captain. He’s calling me.
Yes, sir! I’ll be right there,” shouted Sam, with
delightful informality.
</p>
<p>
He started on a run for the curtained doorway.
He did not slacken his speed as he
stretched out a hand to thrust the curtain aside.
Sam was in so great a hurry that he entirely forgot
that under each watertight door opening was
an iron sill extending upward some eight inches.
</p>
<p>
Sam’s toe caught the projection. Just then
the battleship gave a great lurch to port. This
being the direction in which the boy was traveling
at that moment, it gave him added impetus.
</p>
<p>
The captain opened his eyes in amazement as
Hickey’s red-head shot through the curtain.
</p>
<p>
The Battleship Boy covered about half the
width of the cabin, barely touching the floor with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>
his feet, his arms beating the air wildly in his
fruitless effort to clutch something that was not
moving.
</p>
<p>
Then the crash came.
</p>
<p>
Sam landed on his head and shoulders, skated
along the slippery floor, headed for the captain’s
breakfast table. He hit the mark squarely.
That is, he slid right underneath the table, at the
same time turning over on his back in an effort
to stop his rapid flight.
</p>
<p>
Sam threw up his feet. The move was fatal.
The captain’s table was lifted right up into the
air. A crashing of dishes followed as the table
turned turtle. A shower of broken glassware
rained down over the head of the Battleship
Boy followed quickly by the table itself.
</p>
<p>
Sam lay buried beneath the wreckage.
</p>
<p>
He did not move, not because he could not, but
because he dared not. He feared any movement
on his part would mean the end of the
world so far as he was concerned.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span><a name='chXIX' id='chXIX'></a>CHAPTER XIX—THE WORK OF AN ENEMY</h2>
<p>
“Get up, lad!” commanded the captain,
himself removing the table from his
unfortunate orderly.
</p>
<p>
Sam got himself out from the wreckage, and
slowly rose to his feet, ruefully surveying the
scene before him. He did not speak. There
were no words that would probably express his
feelings at that moment.
</p>
<p>
The captain pressed a button, whereupon his
colored steward hurried in. The steward’s eyes
opened as he caught sight of the ruined china
and glassware.
</p>
<p>
“Steward, clear this rubbish away and be
quick about it,” the captain directed in a calm
voice. “Is this the way you usually respond to
an officer’s summons?” fixing his eyes upon the
culprit. There was a quiver about the lips of
the commanding officer of the battleship “Long
Island,” but Sam was too much upset to observe
it.
</p>
<p>
“N—n—no, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“I approve of your prompt attention to duty,
lad, but you will have to learn to control yourself.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>
</p>
<p>
“I—I am very sorry, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Never mind, lad; you will learn. This is the
first time you ever acted as orderly, is it not?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Then I will instruct you in your duties, for
you no doubt will be called upon to perform this
duty many times during your service.”
</p>
<p>
The captain’s kindly tone went straight to the
heart of the Battleship Boy.
</p>
<p>
“In the first place, when you come to the door
bearing a message for me you should halt outside
and rap, saying, ‘orderly, sir’; then wait
for the summons to enter. When I call you to
give you some directions, you need not rap. Say
nothing, but enter and come to attention. Do
you understand!”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“I am sure you will do better next time. You
will now go to the officer of the deck, and say
that I wish to see Mr. Coates, the executive officer,
at his early convenience.”
</p>
<p>
“Aye, aye, sir,” answered Sam, backing away.
He bethought himself of the door sill just in time
to prevent another tumble, this time out into the
corridor.
</p>
<p>
Sam delivered his message and returned to his
station, where he pondered deeply over what had
befallen him.
</p>
<p>
“I hope the boys don’t hear about that,” he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>
muttered. “They’d make this ship so warm
for me that I should have to jump overboard.
I—I couldn’t stand it; that’s all.”
</p>
<p>
Shortly after that, the captain decided to
make an inspection of the ship. It was a long
and tiresome journey. For the next two hours
Sam Hickey was climbing down and up ladders,
crawling through narrow spaces, his head swimming,
his face red and perspiring.
</p>
<p>
“This orderly business isn’t all it is supposed
to be,” he complained to himself, when once
more they had emerged upon the quarter-deck,
Sam following obediently behind the ship’s
commander. From there, they went to the
bridge.
</p>
<p>
“How are you headed?” questioned the captain
of the man at the wheel.
</p>
<p>
“South, southeast one half,” came the answer.
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Coates, the storm appears to be abating.
I think we may safely turn about and steam
slowly back toward our anchorage now.”
</p>
<p>
They were out of sight of land by this time.
The big ship was turned about and headed back
over the reverse course. At noon, eight bells
again, Hickey was relieved from his duty, another
man taking his place.
</p>
<p>
The boy heaved a deep sigh of relief and hurried
forward to hunt up Dan, to whom he confided his experiences
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>
of the morning. Dan
laughed until he could laugh no more.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t—don’t tell any of the fellows, please,”
begged Sam.
</p>
<p>
“It’s too—it’s too good to keep,” gasped Dan
between laughs.
</p>
<p>
“Dan Davis, if you tell a human being about
that I’ll thrash you worse than either of us
thrashed Bill Kester. Now tell about it, if you
want to.”
</p>
<p>
Dan sobered.
</p>
<p>
“Very well; if you feel that badly about it I
won’t say a word.”
</p>
<p>
“You had better not,” growled Sam.
</p>
<p>
The rest of the afternoon was devoted to
routine duties aboard ship, Sam having gotten
into his old clothes for the work before him.
Painting ship was continued. Corridors and
gun decks showed the result of the work that
already had been done, and the smell of fresh
paint was everywhere.
</p>
<p>
Night came on with the ship nearing her former
anchorage.
</p>
<p>
“We shall have good weather to-morrow,”
announced the ship’s navigator.
</p>
<p>
“I hope so,” answered the captain. “We
want to lay out that mine field and get to work.
We are going to try to beat the record of the
‘Georgia’ this time, providing we have no accidents.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>
That is the main reason why I am so
anxious about the weather.”
</p>
<p>
At last they reached a sheltered spot, anchors
were let go and the battleship swung about, facing
into the rolling sea.
</p>
<p>
That night the Battleship Boys lost no time in
turning in after taps had been sounded. The
ship was rolling more gently now, just enough to
lull them into a sound sleep, their hammocks
swaying slightly under the battleship’s motion.
</p>
<p>
How long they had been asleep they did not
know. All of a sudden Dan uttered a shout and
Sam sprang up, as did many others in the corridor.
</p>
<p>
“Pipe down the racket,” growled several
voices.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter? Is that you, Dan!”
called Sam, observing, in the faint light, that
his companion was not near him.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” answered a muffled voice from below.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the trouble, did you fall out of bed?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know. I guess I did.”
</p>
<p>
“Hurt you any?”
</p>
<p>
“Hurt me? Every bone in my body is
broken.”
</p>
<p>
“Will you rookies shut up and let the rest
of us go to sleep, or must we come down there
and thump you?” demanded a shipmate from
his hammock.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span>
</p>
<p>
“We are not rookies,” protested Sam indignantly.
“We are ordinary seamen.”
</p>
<p>
“My hammock is down,” complained Dan.
</p>
<p>
“Then why don’t you use more care in putting
it up? Hurry and get it in place before any
of the sentries pass here. We, or rather you,
will get on the report if they discover you with
your hammock down.”
</p>
<p>
“I can’t put it up?”
</p>
<p>
“Why not?”
</p>
<p>
“I’m hurt.”
</p>
<p>
Sam was down out of his hammock instantly.
</p>
<p>
“Where are you hurt?”
</p>
<p>
“My wrist. I think I have broken it. I must
have twisted it under me when I fell.”
</p>
<p>
“Then go to the surgeon at once.”
</p>
<p>
“No; not until morning.”
</p>
<p>
The wrist hung limp and Dan seemed unable
to use it at all.
</p>
<p>
“That’s too bad,” exclaimed Sam, his voice
full of concern. “You wait until I fix your
hammock; then I will help you up.”
</p>
<p>
“No, I can’t do it, Sam. I never could get up
there,” complained the lad, holding his wrist,
which was paining him dreadfully.
</p>
<p>
Dan dragged himself to where his hammock
was hanging by one end, the other end lying on
the deck.
</p>
<p>
“It’s curious. I can’t understand it at all.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>
</p>
<p>
“What is?”
</p>
<p>
“I know I triced that up properly last night.
I cannot understand how it ever came down.”
</p>
<p>
Dan stooped over, picking up the ends of the
rope that had secured the hammock to its hooks.
He examined the ends as closely as possible with
one hand injured.
</p>
<p>
“Look here, Sam,” he said, with a trace of
excitement in his tone.
</p>
<p>
“What is it!”
</p>
<p>
“Just examine this rope and see what you
make of it?”
</p>
<p>
Sam did so.
</p>
<p>
“It has been broken, that is all I can discover.”
</p>
<p>
“Then your eyesight must have gone back on
you. There is more to it than that. Don’t you
see anything else wrong with those lashings?”
</p>
<p>
“I do not.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I do.”
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean?”
</p>
<p>
“I mean that my hammock lashings have been
cut. See those strands there? Well, they have
been half severed with a knife. It was intended
that they should not give way at once, but
that they should let me down some time in the
night.”
</p>
<p>
“You—you don’t mean it? Yes, you are
right. They have been cut. Who could have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>
done such a dastardly thing? Why, you might
have killed yourself.”
</p>
<p>
Hickey uttered a low growl.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know who did it,” muttered Davis,
“but if I do find out there will be a real fight on
board this ship, and that without the formality
of a referee.”
</p>
<p>
“Dan this must be reported at once to the
proper person.”
</p>
<p>
“I shall report to no——”
</p>
<p>
“You must report to the sentry on duty outside
without delay. If you do not, I’ll do it myself.
There will be an investigation over this,
and there ought to be.”
</p>
<p>
“There’ll be something more than an investigation,
I reckon,” muttered Seaman Davis, moving
toward the deck, still holding his injured
wrist.
</p>
<h2><a name='chXX' id='chXX'></a>CHAPTER XX—OUT ON THE MINE FIELD</h2>
<p>
An investigation did follow. It began right
after reveille the next morning.
</p>
<p>
As soon as possible, after having gotten
up from his uncomfortable bed on the floor,
Dan hastened to the sick bay, for his wrist was
swelling and demanded immediate attention.
</p>
<p>
The surgeon examined it carefully.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>
</p>
<p>
“You have broken two small bones in the
wrist. How did you do it?”
</p>
<p>
The lad explained.
</p>
<p>
“Very well, I shall have to put you on the
binnacle list to-day. You will not be able to do
any heavy work with that hand for some days
to come.”
</p>
<p>
“I do not wish to go on the binnacle list,” replied
the lad promptly.
</p>
<p>
“You don’t wish to?”
</p>
<p>
“No, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Then you are different from most sailors.
They all pull the list on the slightest pretext,
some under no pretext at all. Why are you so
particular?” questioned the surgeon, his curiosity
aroused by the unusual objection on the
boy’s part.
</p>
<p>
“I expect to have duties to perform.”
</p>
<p>
“What are they?”
</p>
<p>
“Mine work.”
</p>
<p>
“You will not be able to work on mines to-day.
I shall not permit it,” decided the surgeon
firmly.
</p>
<p>
“I hope to go out as a signal man. I can do
that, can I not?”
</p>
<p>
“You might, but I shall advise against it.”
</p>
<p>
“Please do not tell the officers that,” pleaded
Dan. “I want to go. It is my first chance to
prove that I am good for anything at all. I have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>
made a mess of almost everything I have tried
so far.”
</p>
<p>
“I hear differently.”
</p>
<p>
Somehow the earnest young seaman seemed
to appeal to the sympathies of the surgeon. He
was different from the others; perhaps that was
the reason.
</p>
<p>
“From what I have heard I judge that you already
have distinguished yourself,” smiled the
doctor.
</p>
<p>
“How so, sir?”
</p>
<p>
“In the little argument you had with Able
Seaman Kester, for instance.”
</p>
<p>
Dan flushed.
</p>
<p>
“May I go out with the mines, sir?” he asked
hurriedly.
</p>
<p>
“Yes; I’ll let you go, but I shall have to put
you on the report. First, let me bind the wrist
up and splint it. Be as careful of the injured
member as possible. You are liable to do still
further damage if you subject the wrist to any
sudden strain.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll be careful, sir.”
</p>
<p>
After bandaging the wrist, the surgeon allowed
his patient to go. On his morning report
to the captain, giving the list of sick and injured,
the surgeon made the following notation:
</p>
<p>
“Ordinary Seaman Daniel Davis, bones of
wrist fractured, said to have been sustained by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span>
fall from hammock. Refuses to take sick leave
or be placed on binnacle list, saying he has important
duties to perform.”
</p>
<p>
A smile of approval appeared on the face of
the captain when he read the notation.
</p>
<p>
“The boy is all right. He will do all right.
I must keep my eye on him to see that he does
not get sidetracked in the wrong direction.”
</p>
<p>
Calling his orderly the captain said:
</p>
<p>
“Tell the officer of the deck that Ordinary
Seaman Davis is to be excused from heavy duty
to-day. He will go out with the mine boats in
the capacity of signalman. Tell the officer of
the deck to give the proper orders and to have
Davis notified.”
</p>
<p>
The orderly saluted and retired to carry out
the orders of the commanding officer.
</p>
<p>
“I wish there were more such in the Navy,”
mused the captain.
</p>
<p>
With a great rattle and bang the mines were
being hoisted to the deck from somewhere far
down in the ship. Neither lad ever had seen
mines before, and both were curious to know all
about them.
</p>
<p>
Many men now being at work on the quarter-deck,
Sam among the number, Dan was at liberty
to go there and watch the work.
</p>
<p>
The mines were spherical, made of steel and
hollow. They were about two feet in diameter,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>
bolted in the middle. The mine men were now
at work taking the mines apart.
</p>
<p>
Inside the sphere was a can of wet guncotton,
with an opening left for a charge of dry guncotton,
which is put in place when the mines are
being laid for an actual enemy. This was the
only part of the operation that was to be omitted
in the practice work, there being no necessity
for so dangerous an operation.
</p>
<p>
The quarter-deck of the battleship, with all
the apparatus strewn over it, somewhat resembled
a wreck. Down by the sides of the
ship all the boats had been drawn up ready to
receive the heavy mines. In the meantime the
navigator had gone out in the motor boat to
take bearings and place buoys showing where
the mines were to be dropped.
</p>
<p>
“Stand by to launch mines,” came the command
at last.
</p>
<p>
The signal was given by a bugle call. Everyone
was on edge, for the time required to put
the mines over into the small boats was to be
taken and would count on the record.
</p>
<p>
The Battleship Boys climbed over the side
with their signal flags, each dropping into a
whale boat, though the operation proved a
severe strain on Dan’s injured wrist.
</p>
<p>
“Launch mines!”
</p>
<p>
The signal was blown loud and clear.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span>
</p>
<p>
Crash after crash followed the bugle’s command,
as steel met steel when the mines were
clamped together.
</p>
<p>
“Silence!” roared the executive officer as the
men began shouting in their excitement.
</p>
<p>
As fast as the mines were bolted together
they were rolled to the side of the ship. There
tackle was quickly hooked to them, then at command
the heavy spheres were swung over the
side, being carefully lowered to the boats below.
There they were hung over the opposite sides
of the small boats, one mine balancing the
other. This would make placing the mines
much easier than if they were to be taken over
into the boats, for in that case they would have
to be lifted out.
</p>
<p>
In an incredibly short time every one of the
sixteen deadly implements of warfare was on
the boats. Each boat held either an ensign or
a midshipman, who was in command.
</p>
<p>
Sam was in one of the large whaleboats, while
Dan occupied the wherry with an ensign and
an oarsman.
</p>
<p>
“Three minutes, lads,” came the information
from the deck.
</p>
<p>
The jackies sent up a cheer that might have
been heard far over the sunlit sea. The morning
was a glorious one, the sea having quieted
down to a sluggish roll that scarcely disturbed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span>
the ship at all, though the small boats bobbed
about somewhat, thus giving more zest to the
work.
</p>
<p>
“Lay mines,” came the command.
</p>
<p>
Half a hundred hardy tars bent themselves
to the oars and the fleet of boats slipped away
from the towering sides of the “Long Island,”
the men pulling for the mine field off to the
southeast.
</p>
<p>
Each Battleship Boy carried a spy glass
under his arm. Now and then he would place
it to his eye for a long look at the ship.
</p>
<p>
“The ship is making signals, sir,” Dan informed
the ensign in command of his boat.
</p>
<p>
“What do they want?”
</p>
<p>
“They are saying that whaleboat number two
is off its course, sir. Orders, sir, to bear more
to the southwest.”
</p>
<p>
“Wherry, there,” spelled Dan. “That’s us.”
He acknowledged the signal.
</p>
<p>
“Pull up. Wherry lagging behind!”
</p>
<p>
Dan translated the message to his superior
officer. The lad was glad that it was not he
who was tugging at the oars, for the perspiration
was dripping from the face of the oarsman
by this time.
</p>
<p>
As each boat reached the buoy where it was
to locate its mine, the men would toss their oars
as a signal that they were ready. Some time
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span>
was required for all the boats to get in their
proper places.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime Dan Davis was standing up
in the wherry with his flag ready for signaling.
At last the oars in each boat of the fleet were
tossed, which means held upright.
</p>
<p>
“Ready,” wig-wagged the Battleship Boy.
</p>
<p>
He held his flag high above his head with one
hand—the injured one—the other hand holding
the spy glass to his eye watching the signal
halyards of the battleship.
</p>
<p>
A flag fluttered to the breeze on the ship.
Instantly Dan dipped his own signal flag.
</p>
<p>
A splash from a cutter, followed by a series
of splashes from the other boats of the little
fleet, told him that the mines were going overboard.
</p>
<p>
The second leg of the contest against time
was on. Sam Hickey sat in the whaleboat irritated
because he had had little or nothing to
do. Had he but known it, however, there was
plenty of opportunity ahead of him to enable
the lad to show the stuff he was made of.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span><a name='chXXI' id='chXXI'></a>CHAPTER XXI—BREAKING THE RECORD</h2>
<p>
“There goes the last of them,” shouted
the officer in Dan’s boat.
</p>
<p>
Dan raised his flag, making the signal
333. This he did three times, indicating that
the work was finished.
</p>
<p>
“What is the time, sir?”
</p>
<p>
“Three minutes and twenty seconds,” replied
the officer. “That breaks the record.” Picking
up his megaphone the officer shouted out
the tidings to the men who were out on the
mine field. “Three minutes and twenty seconds,”
he bellowed. “Best previous time beaten
by forty seconds.”
</p>
<p>
A great cheer broke from the jackies drifting
about in their little boats over the mine field.
Batteries had been placed, everything had been
done within the time named, and had the mines
been charged with dry guncotton any ship running
into them would undoubtedly have been
blown up.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime Dan Davis was signaling
the news to the battleship.
</p>
<p>
The “Long Island,” expressed her congratulations
in three long blasts of her siren,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span>
at which the jackies set up another cheer. This
time the cheer reached to the ship itself.
</p>
<p>
“Battleship making signal of general recall,
sir,” Dan informed his superior.
</p>
<p>
“Return to ship,” shouted the officer through
his megaphone.
</p>
<p>
All boats were now turned back. The mines
were to be left as they were until later in the
day, or perhaps until the next day, when they
would be taken up. As a general rule planted
mines are left out for twenty-four hours.
</p>
<p>
Good time was made on the return, for it was
nearly time for the noonday mess, and every
man in the outfit had a sharpened appetite after
the morning’s exertions.
</p>
<p>
Reaching the ship, the men piled over the
side to the quarter-deck, where a number of the
officers were gathered. The men were called
to attention on the quarter-deck. Stepping out
before them, the captain said:
</p>
<p>
“You have done well, lads. If you do as well
in taking up the mines, our record will stand
a long time before it is beaten. I congratulate
you all, and I have also sent a wireless message
to the admiral telling him of your good
work.”
</p>
<p>
The bugle blew for dinner and all hands hurried
to the mess rooms, where they were left
undisturbed for the next hour. This is one of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span>
the few hours in the sailor’s day when he is
never disturbed, except in case of emergency.
</p>
<p>
The moment the sailors sit down to their meals
the little triangular red flag mounts quickly up
the signal halyard, where it is left fluttering
to the breeze until the meal is finished. That,
also, is one hour of the day when visitors are
not welcomed aboard ship.
</p>
<p>
Dinner over, the smoke lamp was lit for half
an hour, when all hands lounged about decks,
many smoking and telling stories. The jackies
were unusually jubilant on this sunny afternoon,
for they had set a mark in mine planting
that would make their companions on the other
ships of the service more than envious.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly a bugle trilled out the strains of
an order.
</p>
<p>
“Mine crews take to the boats!” bellowed a
boatswain’s mate.
</p>
<p>
The jackies uttered a shout. In a moment
the scene of quiet on the forecastle was changed
into one of quick action. White-clad figures
were running and leaping for the quarter-deck,
whence they boarded the small boats. This
was the landing place, the quarter-deck being
lower than any other part of the ship.
</p>
<p>
The men who had been tending the small
boats trailing out astern of the battleship had
quickly propelled their craft alongside and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211'></a>211</span>
were lying in readiness to take the crews on
board.
</p>
<p>
The jackies piled over the sides of the ship
noisily, the officers making no attempt to check
their enthusiasm, well realizing that it was because
the men were in great haste to get out to
the mine field and get the mines up in record-breaking
time.
</p>
<p>
Dan Davis and Sam Hickey were well up
with the first to reach the quarter-deck, though
Dan was obliged to favor his lame wrist, now
paining him severely. This delayed him somewhat
in getting down the sea ladder, performing
the feat with one free hand being rather
awkward.
</p>
<p>
“Hurry up, elephant feet,” shouted a voice
from above.
</p>
<p>
“Come on, don’t be all day about it,” urged
a companion from below. At the same instant
some one grabbed Dan’s feet, giving him a violent
tug, which brought him down in a hurry.
Dan landed across one of the seats in the whaleboat
with his injured hand doubled under him.
</p>
<p>
He felt sure he heard the wrist snap. The
pain was almost unbearable.
</p>
<p>
“That’s the way to get down when you are
in a hurry, and especially when some one else
is in more of a hurry than you are.”
</p>
<p>
The boy’s face was pale, but despite the pain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span>
in his wrist he smiled bravely as he climbed
into the wherry moored alongside.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter with the hand?”
</p>
<p>
“I broke my wrist this morning,” answered
Dan coolly. “That’s all. Nothing very much.”
</p>
<p>
“Did you hurt it again just now?” demanded
the jackie who had pulled him down.
</p>
<p>
“I may have broken a few bones more or less,
but don’t let a little thing like that worry you.
‘Pills’ can patch it up when we get back. Not
a word,” warned Dan, with sudden interest as
he saw the jackie preparing to speak to the
ensign in charge of the boat. Dan did not relish
the thought of being ordered back to the
ship.
</p>
<p>
“Just as you say, matey. You’ve got the
grit. I ought not to have yanked you down
that way, but I didn’t know.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s all right,” smiled Dan.
</p>
<p>
“Take up mines,” blew the bugle.
</p>
<p>
“Cast off,” commanded the coxswains of the
various boats, whereupon all the small boats
seemed to leap clear of the ship.
</p>
<p>
Dan, in his small wherry, was lagging behind
as usual. In his case the boat had only one
oarsman, while the other boats had several, but
the single oarsman did very well. The tide
was running in, which helped them all more
or less.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span>
</p>
<p>
The boy was holding his wrist, the pain
growing more and more severe as the moments
passed. By this time the wrist had begun to
swell until the bandage about it fairly cut into
the flesh.
</p>
<p>
“I hope I shall be able to stand it until I
get back,” he muttered. “I guess I’ll have
to, unless I jump overboard.”
</p>
<p>
Leaning over the side he trailed the hand in
the cool water, which seemed to relieve the
pain a little.
</p>
<p>
Reaching the mine field, the boats quickly
took their various stations, and the men, resting
on their oars, awaited the command, “Take
up mines.”
</p>
<p>
The command came a few minutes later.
</p>
<p>
How the jackies did work! The great
spheres came up dripping from the salt sea,
and in much quicker time than they had been
planted.
</p>
<p>
“We have broken all records now for sure.
Three minutes flat! Signal the ship,” ordered
the officer in command.
</p>
<p>
Dan wig-wagged the time, and the boats
started away with the mines hanging over the
sides, the jackies singing as they pulled lustily
for home.
</p>
<p>
All at once there was a loud splash from
whaleboat number two, the boat lurched heavily, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214'></a>214</span>
weight of the mine on the opposite side
pulling it over.
</p>
<p>
Hickey, who was standing up watching the
ship for signals, went overboard head first.
The mine on the opposite side, slipping its
fastenings, had gone to the bottom in three
fathoms of water.
</p>
<p>
But the red head of Sam Hickey appeared
above the surface of the water almost at once.
He struck out for the boat, blowing the water
from mouth and nose, while his companions
shouted encouraging words to him.
</p>
<p>
Several made ready to go overboard to the
lad’s rescue, but as soon as he was able to free
his mouth and nose of water he called to them
not to do so. Despite the severe effort of swimming
against a strong tide, Hickey finally made
the boat, though well-nigh exhausted when at
last he stretched up his hands, grasping the
gunwale of the whaleboat. The jackies hauled
him in, joking over his misfortune.
</p>
<p>
“Didn’t soak the color out of your hair, did
it, red-head?”
</p>
<p>
“No; all fast colors, warranted not to run,”
retorted Sam quickly.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, Dan Davis was standing
up in the little wherry making efforts to attract
the attention of the battleship. At last
he succeeded in doing so.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span>
</p>
<p>
“Mine number six gone overboard,” he wig-wagged.
</p>
<p>
“How much water?” asked the battleship.
</p>
<p>
“Three and a half fathoms.”
</p>
<p>
“Ask for orders,” commanded the officer in
charge.
</p>
<p>
“Orders?” signaled Dan.
</p>
<p>
“Wherry lay to, to locate the mine. All
other boats come in.”
</p>
<p>
“I understand,” answered Dan.
</p>
<p>
“Signaling again, sir,” informed Dan.
</p>
<p>
“What do they say?”
</p>
<p>
“They have ordered that the signalman from
the whaleboat number two remain here in the
wherry, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Very well, call the signalman from whaleboat
number two. We shall have this wherry
so heavily loaded that she’ll sink if we get in
much of a seaway.”
</p>
<p>
Dan wig-wagged with his sound hand to the
whaleboat, giving the orders to Hickey to join
him in the wherry. The officer in charge of
the whaleboat grumbled at being thus obliged
to turn back and travel some distance to reach
the wherry. The latter had by this time cast
out an anchor so as to hold the boat in
place near the spot where the mine had gone
down.
</p>
<p>
“What is this for?” demanded Sam, clambering over into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216'></a>216</span>
the wherry, his clothes still
wet and dripping.
</p>
<p>
“I did not think best to ask the captain for
his reasons for giving the orders,” answered
Dan, with a meaning smile.
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t mean that. Look out, the ship is
making signals. Why don’t you tend to your
business?” demanded Sam.
</p>
<p>
Dan’s spyglass quickly went to his eye. He
lowered the glass after a moment, turning to
the officer in command of the wherry.
</p>
<p>
“Diver coming out to go down for the mine,
sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Very good. I knew they would send out a
diver.”
</p>
<p>
“Is he going to dive for it?” questioned Sam,
a new interest showing in his eyes.
</p>
<p>
“Yes; he will go down in one of those diving
suits we saw on deck this morning. Did you
never see a diver at work?”
</p>
<p>
“Never,” answered Sam. “I should like to.”
</p>
<p>
“You will have the opportunity very soon.”
</p>
<p>
“I think the boat is coming over there now,
sir,” added Dan, addressing the ensign.
</p>
<p>
“Cast the lead line over and see if you can
locate the mine, lads.”
</p>
<p>
They could not. In a short time the boat
with the diver and diving apparatus pulled up
and began getting ready for work.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217'></a>217</span>
</p>
<p>
“Look,” whispered Dan.
</p>
<p>
The diver was none other than Bill Kester,
his face swathed in plaster, his eyes scowling
menacingly as he recognized the Battleship
Boys.
</p>
<h2><a name='chXXII' id='chXXII'></a>CHAPTER XXII—BURIED THREE FATHOMS DEEP</h2>
<p>
“Where does she lay, sir?” questioned
the assistant who had come with
the diver and his apparatus.
</p>
<p>
“As near as we could determine the mine
should be about fifteen yards to the southwest
of us. Bring your boat around to leeward and
make a sounding. We did not dare move over
for fear of losing our location entirely.”
</p>
<p>
“May I make a suggestion, sir?” questioned
Dan, touching his cap.
</p>
<p>
“Certainly; what is it?”
</p>
<p>
“I got a quick bearing when the mine went
over.”
</p>
<p>
“You did?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“What was it?”
</p>
<p>
“Taking the bearing from our present position,
a line drawn from the lighthouse to the
battleship, crossed by a line from our wherry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span>
to that bluff yonder, would mark the location
of the mine at the crossing point, sir.”
</p>
<p>
The ensign glanced at the young seaman
quizzically.
</p>
<p>
“Very well done, my lad. You have the
making of a first-class navigator in you. Keep
on and you will do well. Always use your
eyes, and your head as well, as you have done
this afternoon and there will be no doubt
about it.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you, sir,” answered the boy, his
face glowing with pride.
</p>
<p>
By this time the men were laying out the
diving suit for the diver, the hideous-looking
helmet having been placed on the stern seat of
the cutter that had brought them over.
</p>
<p>
“Sound for that mine before you put the
diver over,” commanded the ensign. “No use
bottling the man up until you are ready to send
him down.”
</p>
<p>
“This helmet is not fit to use, sir,” spoke
up one of the diver’s assistants.
</p>
<p>
“What is the matter with it?”
</p>
<p>
“It leaks. See?” He held up the helmet,
which he had partially filled with water, for
the inspection of the officer.
</p>
<p>
“It has lain out on deck too long. The sun
has checked it,” continued the man.
</p>
<p>
“It should be your business to see that the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span>
sun did not check it. I shall have to place you
on the report,” replied the officer.
</p>
<p>
“I was ordered to get the apparatus on deck
this morning, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Davis, signal the ship to send out another
diving suit. Tell them this one is out of order.”
</p>
<p>
“Aye, aye, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Ask them to send it out in a hurry, for the
wind is coming up. I fear we shall have some
rough water. Hickey, sit up there. Don’t you
know it is against the regulations to lounge
about in the small boats? I am surprised at
you.”
</p>
<p>
Sam’s face flushed. He sat up, gripping his
signal staff half angrily. He made no complaint,
but saluted. Sam was not in the best
of humor at this moment. He took an instant
and violent dislike for the young officer who
had rebuked him.
</p>
<p>
Dan, in the meanwhile, was wig-wagging to
the ship, sending the request for another diving
suit.
</p>
<p>
A few moments later, as he peered through
the spy glass, he saw a boat starting off in
their direction.
</p>
<p>
“Motor boat under way. I think she is coming
with the diving suit, sir,” Davis called.
</p>
<p>
“Very good. Have you located that mine
yet, men?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span>
</p>
<p>
“I think we have, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Then hold it. Do not let it get away from
you. We shall remain on the anchorage here
until you get your anchor down.”
</p>
<p>
As soon as this had been done the wherry
moved up closer, keeping just far enough away
to avoid interfering with the diver when he
got at his work on the bottom of the sea.
</p>
<p>
Immediately upon the arrival of the motor
boat the men began hurriedly assisting Kester
on with his diving suit, for it was getting late,
and the wind was freshening considerably.
</p>
<p>
“All ready to put the diver overboard, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Very good. Make sure that all is well before
doing so.”
</p>
<p>
“All is in proper condition.”
</p>
<p>
The diver, as he stood waiting for the order
to descend, appeared in his diving suit like
some strange and hideous monster from the
deep. Sam gazed at him in wide-eyed wonder.
</p>
<p>
“Then put him over.”
</p>
<p>
A splash followed, the diver disappearing beneath
the water, while the diver’s assistants
rapidly paid out the rubber tubing and the
ropes attached to the diver’s costume.
</p>
<p>
“Bottom, sir,” announced the man at the
ropes.
</p>
<p>
“Watch his signals.”
</p>
<p>
“Aye, aye, sir.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221'></a>221</span>
</p>
<p>
There followed several minutes of tense waiting,
the rhythmic “clank!” “clank!” of the apparatus
that supplied the diver with fresh air
being the only sound save the lapping of the
water to break the stillness.
</p>
<p>
“He’s found the mine, sir,” called the diver’s
assistant.
</p>
<p>
“Very good. Davis, signal the ship that we
have located the mine.”
</p>
<p>
Dan stood up, flashing the message through
with a few swift dips of the signal flag. Sam
wondered how they knew the man, Kester,
had found what he was in search of. What
he did not know was that the men in the other
boat were able to hold a limited conversation
with the diver by means of a signal rope, certain
jerks meaning certain words or questions.
</p>
<p>
“The mine is secured, sir,” called the assistant.
</p>
<p>
This meant that the diver had succeeded in
making fast to the lost mine one of the ropes
that he had taken down with him.
</p>
<p>
“Shall we raise the mine first before getting
Kester up, sir?”
</p>
<p>
“By all means. He has not asked to be
brought up, has he?”
</p>
<p>
“No, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Haul away, then, lads.”
</p>
<p>
A warning signal was sent to the man below,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span>
after which the assistants in the boat began
pulling and tugging at the rope attached to the
mine.
</p>
<p>
Evidently the mine was imbedded in the
sandy bottom, for it refused to move, the men
jerking this way and that to free it from its
resting place.
</p>
<p>
All at once it did come away, and with a
suddenness that caused the men to sit down
in the bottom of the boat, losing control of the
line.
</p>
<p>
“Clumsy! Look out or you will lose it
again,” cautioned the ensign.
</p>
<p>
Quickly pulling themselves up, they began
hauling in on the line. Very slowly the sphere
moved upward, at last appearing above the
surface of the water, shining and almost menacing
Dan thought as he gazed at the object.
</p>
<p>
“Now be careful in getting it over the side,”
warned the officer.
</p>
<p>
The diver had put what he considered to be
a strong hitch on the mine with the end of the
hauling rope. On account of the depth at
which he was working, however, the darkness
compelled him to operate solely by the sense
of feeling.
</p>
<p>
The mine was now swaying on the gunwale
of the rolling small boat, the waves from the
rising sea breaking over into the cutter as well
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223'></a>223</span>
as into the other boat, until the men were standing
in the salt brine.
</p>
<p>
“Look out! There she goes!”
</p>
<p>
With a great splash the mine struck the
water, having slipped its lashings, and quickly
sank out of sight.
</p>
<p>
“Warn the diver!” shouted the ensign.
</p>
<p>
A jerk on the signal cord conveyed the message
that the mine was falling toward him.
</p>
<p>
“Does he answer?”
</p>
<p>
“No, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Quick! Give him another warning!”
</p>
<p>
“He does not answer, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“There goes the signal line! It’s fouled,
sir!”
</p>
<p>
A violent wrench on the supporting line with
which the diver was to be hoisted to the surface
tore it loose from its fastening on board
the diver’s boat.
</p>
<p>
“The line’s gone, sir!”
</p>
<p>
All hands were standing up in the rocking
boats. The sky had suddenly become overcast
and spray was dashing over them in blinding
sheets.
</p>
<p>
Sam stood as if dazed. He did not catch the
full significance of the scene, but his mind was
working. Like a flash it dawned upon him.
</p>
<p>
“There goes the air tube. That settles him,
sir!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224'></a>224</span>
</p>
<p>
“What does it mean?” stammered Sam.
</p>
<p>
“The diver is drowning three fathoms under
the sea. Nothing can save him,” groaned some
one.
</p>
<p>
An instant of silence followed.
</p>
<p>
Dan threw up his flag signaling, “accident.”
</p>
<p>
Then a body flashed through the air. The
dazed spectators caught sight of a white service
uniform, as the intrepid Dan Davis plunged into
the sea, disappearing beneath the waves.
</p>
<p>
Sam’s flagstaff struck the gunwale with a
bang an instant later, toppled over and was
quickly carried away. Ere it had reached the
water, however, the second Battleship Boy had
leaped to the bow of the boat and before they
could utter a word of warning, he had followed
his chum Davis with a long, clean dive into the
ocean.
</p>
<h2><a name='chXXIII' id='chXXIII'></a>CHAPTER XXIII—HEROES TO THE RESCUE</h2>
<p>
“Men overboard from the wherry!” bellowed
a voice in the motor boat that
had brought out the second diving
suit.
</p>
<p>
“Stand by to pick them up!” roared the ensign.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225'></a>225</span>
</p>
<p>
“They’ll never make it. Shall we go over,
sir, and help them out when they come up?”
asked a seaman.
</p>
<p>
“Stand by! Not a man of you goes over.
You couldn’t live in this sea. The fools—to do
a thing like that!”
</p>
<p>
The wind had increased to a gale, great walls
of water hurling themselves against the frail
craft and breaking over them in quick succession.
</p>
<p>
“Bail boat,” commanded the ensign.
</p>
<p>
“Aye, aye, sir.”
</p>
<p>
It seemed as if every moment would be the
last for the small boats, but not a man showed
the least trace of excitement, either in face or
voice.
</p>
<p>
“Anchor’s giving way, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Stand by the oars. Hold your bow to the
wind. Keep them up, lads. And not a signalman
on board to tell the ship we are in trouble!”
the officer muttered to himself.
</p>
<p>
Off on the battleship, however, a dozen glasses
were leveled in their direction and as many keen
eyes were gazing toward them over the troubled
sea.
</p>
<p>
“Small boat appears to be in trouble, sir,”
called the quartermaster, who, standing on the
quarter-deck of the battleship, was bracing his
glass against a stanchion. The ship’s lookouts
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226'></a>226</span>
had failed to catch Dan Davis’s quick signal of
“accident.”
</p>
<p>
“Have they asked for assistance?” questioned
the executive officer.
</p>
<p>
“No, sir. I have seen no signals in some
time.”
</p>
<p>
“Not since the diver went overboard?”
</p>
<p>
“Not since they made signal that the mine had
been located.”
</p>
<p>
“What do you think about it, Coates?” asked
the captain, peering through his own glasses,
now and then catching a glimpse of the boats
through the mist of white spray that enveloped
them.
</p>
<p>
“Two men missing from the wherry, sir,”
called the quartermaster, with no trace of excitement.
</p>
<p>
“Steamer number one!” roared Lieutenant
Commander Coates, the executive officer.
</p>
<p>
“Aye, aye, sir,” came the answer, borne
faintly on the gale.
</p>
<p>
“Cast off and proceed full speed to the assistance
of boats on the mine field.”
</p>
<p>
The steamer’s crew needed no urging to leap
to their work. Some of their comrades were in
distress. Lines were cast off, boat hooks were
quickly thrust against the side of the ship to
prevent the little steamer from being dashed to
pieces against it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227'></a>227</span>
</p>
<p>
“All clear!”
</p>
<p>
With a shrill blast of her whistle steamer
number one rounded the ship’s bow in a cloud
of blinding spray and headed for the mine field.
The officer in charge had been given the number
of the mine, and the bearings, as he started away,
so that by the aid of the compass he was enabled
to direct a straight course to the scene of the
trouble.
</p>
<p>
It seemed as if the staunch little steamer must
turn over as she plunged along through the seas
that were smiting her with increased force every
moment.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime the men in the little boats on
the mine field, were fighting desperately to keep
their craft near the spot where two men had
gone down to battle for the life of a third down
under the sea.
</p>
<p>
The Battleship Boys were splendid swimmers
else they never would have been able to wriggle
their way through the water to the bottom. Dan
was somewhat hampered too, by the coil of line
that he had instinctively gathered in his hand
as he prepared to leap from the boat.
</p>
<p>
By rare good luck, his hands gripped the helmet
of Kester, who lay on his back drifting
slowly along, the weight at his feet holding him
down not far from the sea bottom.
</p>
<p>
Dan made a desperate effort to pass the line
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228'></a>228</span>
about the drowning man. By this time, however,
it seemed as if the boy’s breath would burst
from him. He could hold it only a second or so
longer.
</p>
<p>
At that instant a new form hovered close to
him. It was the red-haired Sam. With quick
instinct Dan thrust the rope into the hands of
his companion, and struck out for the surface.
</p>
<p>
Those in the boats made him out the instant
his head was poked above the water. The boats
were close by.
</p>
<p>
“There he is!” yelled a voice. “Wait; we’ll
cast a rope.”
</p>
<p>
Dan shook his head, once more plunging
under, swimming for the bottom with long, powerful
strokes.
</p>
<p>
He had great difficulty this time in finding the
spot he was in search of, for in his rise to the
surface he had been carried some twenty feet
from the place where Kester lay.
</p>
<p>
He reached it at last. Sam had gotten the
rope about the neck of the diver but was too
much exhausted to make a hitch.
</p>
<p>
Dan pushed him toward the surface. Working
desperately Davis at last succeeded in completing
the work that Sam had well-nigh finished.
</p>
<p>
The boy’s mind was working with lightning-like
rapidity. He knew that he could not hope
to get the drowning man to the surface by his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229'></a>229</span>
own efforts. There was only one way that this
could possibly be accomplished. That was to
get to the surface himself and try to draw Kester
up. Dan did not know whether the rope
would reach that distance or not.
</p>
<p>
“I must do it!” he thought.
</p>
<p>
Grasping the end of the rope he dashed upward
for the surface. On the way he met a figure
coming down. It was Sam. Dan grabbed him
and by a series of quick pinches managed to convey
the word that the red-headed boy was to return
to the surface.
</p>
<p>
Sam wriggled about and struck out for the
upper air.
</p>
<p>
Hickey’s red head appeared in a swirl of
water and spray. He shook his head, gasping
for breath, nearly drowning himself in the effort
to get even a little fresh air into his lungs.
</p>
<p>
An instant later Dan leaped to the surface.
</p>
<p>
Dan gave a wig-wag signal with one hand,
meaning “help.”
</p>
<p>
By this time the small boats had drifted too
far away to be able to reach them quickly.
</p>
<p>
But steamer number one had reached the
scene. She gave a short, sharp blast of her
whistle to show that those aboard had seen and
understood the situation.
</p>
<p>
“Is he lost?” gasped Sam.
</p>
<p>
“N-n-no. I’ve got him at the end of the rope.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230'></a>230</span>
Help me quick. He must be dead by this time.
There comes the steamer. Oh, why don’t they
hurry?”
</p>
<p>
“Where is the rope?”
</p>
<p>
“Here! Help me with it. I’m getting tired.”
</p>
<p>
Dan was holding to the rope with all his
strength, trying to retain his hold of it and at
the same time keep himself from sinking. Some
invisible power seemed to be pulling him downward.
</p>
<p>
The ensign and his oarsman had gotten aboard
the steamer, trailing their wherry behind it.
The ensign was standing in the bow with a rope
in his hand.
</p>
<p>
As the steamer, lifting on a great swell,
dropped down within reaching distance he made
a cast. Dan reached for the rope and missed
it.
</p>
<p>
“Lay alongside, sir,” commanded Dan, with
a feeble effort at saluting with his injured hand.
</p>
<p>
“Can’t do it. We will run you down in this
sea. Look out for the next cast.”
</p>
<p>
“You’ll have to hurry, sir. We’ve got a
drowning man under the water here, sir. Lay
over, no matter if you do run us down. Quick!”
</p>
<p>
A sudden, but quickly suppressed exclamation
escaped the ensign.
</p>
<p>
“Take hold; I’m going to let go,” gasped
Dan.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231'></a>231</span>
</p>
<p>
Sam grabbed the rope from the hands of his
companion, but Dan suddenly snatched it away
again, observing that his companion was getting
weak.
</p>
<p>
“Can you take care of yourself?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” replied Sam faintly.
</p>
<p>
The next time the line was cast from the
steamer, Davis grabbed it, and with his burden
was quickly hauled alongside the plunging
steamer. Willing hands grabbed the lad, dragging
him aboard and then began a frantic effort
to pull up the drowning diver. Kester was
hauled over the steamer’s side a few seconds
later.
</p>
<p>
The helmet was jerked from the head of the
diver in wonderfully quick time, and then began
a hurried effort to restore him to consciousness.
</p>
<p>
“Sam! Sam! Where is Sam?” cried Dan
wildly.
</p>
<p>
For the first time they noticed that the red-headed
boy was not on board.
</p>
<p>
“There! There! He’s sinking!”
</p>
<p>
Dan made a rush to leap overboard.
</p>
<p>
“Hold him!” cried the ensign.
</p>
<p>
Two sailors fastened upon the Battleship Boy
at the instant he was about to take the plunge.
</p>
<p>
“Keep working on Kester, and don’t let the
boy get away. I hold you responsible for him.”
</p>
<p>
The ensign cleared the rail with a bound, leaping far
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232'></a>232</span>
out into the boiling sea, but Dan had
not observed it. Giving a sudden tug, the boy
freed himself from his companions. He was
overboard in a twinkling. A boathook hauled
him back, protesting and fighting to get away.
</p>
<p>
“The ensign is over. No need for you to go.”
</p>
<p>
It was the same ensign who had rebuked Sam
earlier in the day, and against whom the lad
had taken a sudden and violent dislike on that
account.
</p>
<p>
“Full speed ahead,” commanded the coxswain
of the little steamer.
</p>
<p>
“Steady there, helmsman; don’t run them
down.”
</p>
<p>
A desperate struggle followed amid the
smashing seas. By this time the steamer was
hard by.
</p>
<p>
“Cast a rope,” commanded the coxswain. A
coil shot through the air, landing over the ensign’s
shoulder. He fastened upon it instantly,
and a few moments later was drawn slowly to
the steamer, one hand clinging to Hickey’s red
hair. The two men were hauled aboard in a
half-drowned condition. Dan was the worst off
of the three, however. He was not only suffering
from broken bones but he had been under
water for a long time. He was barely able to
speak now. His face was pale and drawn and
his legs seemed unable to support him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233'></a>233</span>
</p>
<p>
The first act of the ensign upon getting
aboard, was to spring over to where Kester lay
stretched out in the bottom of the steamer, the
men still working over him, applying the methods
that they had learned at the training station.
Some of the men had been through the experience
before and knew what to do.
</p>
<p>
“Is he dead?” questioned the officer.
</p>
<p>
“No, sir, I think not. See, the color is coming
into his cheeks.”
</p>
<p>
The ensign drew a deep breath of relief.
</p>
<p>
“Gangway! Let me have a hand, lads,” he
cried.
</p>
<p>
But the men stood fast.
</p>
<p>
“You are not fit for it, sir,” answered Dan
Davis, barring the way. “Please, sir, sit down
and rest yourself. We are fresh and you are
not.”
</p>
<p>
“You are——”
</p>
<p>
The words seemed to stick in the ensign’s
mouth.
</p>
<p>
“My lad, I think you have quite as much right
to rest as have I. Stand aside,” he added in a
stern tone.
</p>
<p>
Dan fell back. The officer began working
over the body of the diver, bringing his longer
experience into play. In a very short time Kester
was coughing and choking. It appeared almost
as if he were strangling.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234'></a>234</span>
</p>
<p>
“Shall we get under way, sir?” questioned
the coxswain.
</p>
<p>
“Are we all here?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir. The other boats are tied astern,
their crews on board.”
</p>
<p>
“Get under way as quickly as possible. Run
as fast as you dare. These men need the attention
of the surgeon.”
</p>
<p>
“Aye, aye, sir. Full speed ahead!”
</p>
<p>
The steamer plunged away headed for the
battleship. But still the ensign and his men
worked over the diver. Little by little he regained
consciousness. He was too weak to do
more than glance about at them slowly, then his
eyes closed wearily.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll save him,” muttered the officer. “We
must save him.”
</p>
<p>
“Catch Davis,” shouted a voice.
</p>
<p>
A Jackie caught the boy just in time to prevent
Dan from going overboard. They hauled
him back with a laughing remark. Dan wavered
on his feet for a few seconds then plunged heavily
forward on his face.
</p>
<p>
“He’s fainted, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Let him alone. We shall be aboard ship in
a few moments. He will recover by that time.”
</p>
<p>
Soon after that the little steamer ran in under
the lee of the battleship. The rail was lined
with officers and men.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235'></a>235</span>
</p>
<p>
“Anyone lost?” called the executive officer.
</p>
<p>
“No, sir; got them all. Two men in bad
shape. Pass over a sling.”
</p>
<p>
Sam was kneeling beside his unconscious companion
a troubled look on his face.
</p>
<p>
Almost at once a rope sling was passed over
the side. The men reached for the unconscious
boy. Sam motioned to the diver.
</p>
<p>
“Take him first,” directed the lad. “He is
the worst off.”
</p>
<p>
Bill Kester, therefore, was hoisted to the deck;
then came Dan Davis. Tenderly they laid him
on the deck. Stretchers were brought and the
patients were started quickly for the sick bay.
</p>
<p>
“Ensign, what happened?” demanded the
captain.
</p>
<p>
“Briefly, sir, those two lads made the most
heroic rescue that I ever either saw or heard of.
Especial credit is due to Ordinary Seaman Davis
for his wonderful and heroic efforts.”
</p>
<p>
The young officer related all that had occurred
out on the mine field, to which the commanding
officer together with a group of other ship
officers listened with grave faces.
</p>
<p>
“Orderly.”
</p>
<p>
The captain’s voice was full of decision.
</p>
<p>
“Go to the sick bay. Run! Tell the surgeon
to send the boy to my cabin.”
</p>
<p>
“Davis, sir?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236'></a>236</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes, and, Ord’ly.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Tell the surgeon I wish the boy to be put in
my bed. Tell the surgeon to report to me as
soon as he has examined the boy.”
</p>
<h2><a name='chXXIV' id='chXXIV'></a>CHAPTER XXIV—CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>
“You say the boy is out of his head?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir; he is in a high fever,” answered
the surgeon.
</p>
<p>
“Nothing more than exposure is it?” questioned
the captain.
</p>
<p>
“He had a broken wrist when he went out this
morning. I understand he broke it again in getting
into the whale boat this morning. I advised
that he go on binnacle list for the day, but Davis
refused. He said he had duties to perform, that
he must go.”
</p>
<p>
“You should have declined to permit it.”
</p>
<p>
“I could not well do so, sir. I admired the
boy’s spirit too much to order him on the list.”
</p>
<p>
The captain nodded reflectively.
</p>
<p>
“The Secretary of the Navy shall be informed
of this at once. Mr. Coates!”
</p>
<p>
The executive officer approached.
</p>
<p>
“Never in my experience have I known of such
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237'></a>237</span>
unselfish heroism as those two lads have shown
to-day. Kester is the man with whom young
Davis and Hickey had difficulties, is he not?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“And to-day the boys save his life. By the
way, surgeon, how did the lad break his wrist
in the first place?”
</p>
<p>
“I believe it was through a fall from his hammock.”
</p>
<p>
“I looked into that matter, sir,” spoke up the
executive officer. “I learn that Davis’s hammock
lashings had been cut during the night, or
some time earlier. At least he did not observe
the fact and got his tumble after he had been
asleep several hours.”
</p>
<p>
“Find the man who did that. He shall be dismissed
from the service instantly.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“What is the boy’s temperature?”
</p>
<p>
“One hundred and four,” answered the
surgeon.
</p>
<p>
“You have a nurse with him?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“See that nothing is omitted that will make
for his comfort. Mr. Coates, you see to it that the
affidavits of the witnesses to that heroic rescue,
are taken at once. Have them ready for my signature
at the earliest possible moment as I wish
to forward them to Washington no later than
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238'></a>238</span>
to-morrow morning, with especial recommendation
for Ordinary Seaman Davis.”
</p>
<p>
“Ordinary Seaman Hickey requests permission
to sit with the man Davis, sir,” announced
a messenger.
</p>
<p>
“Permit Ordinary Seaman Hickey to do whatever
he wishes on this ship so long as his requests
are not in violation of regulations,” replied
the captain, with emphasis. “There is a
divan in my bedroom that he can sleep on. Keep
me informed, doctor, on the lad’s condition.”
</p>
<p>
“Very good, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Is Kester in a serious condition?”
</p>
<p>
“I think not. He should be around in a few
days at the most. He is too tough to be downed
thus easily.”
</p>
<p>
“Davis downed him the other night,” laughed
the executive officer.
</p>
<p>
For two days Dan Davis raged in delirium;
then on the morning of the third day, as the ship
was riding easily at anchor, the sun peeping
through the portholes of the cabin, the Battleship
Boy opened his eyes. He gazed about him
wonderingly.
</p>
<p>
“What place is this?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
“This is the captain’s cabin.”
</p>
<p>
“Am I the captain?”
</p>
<p>
“No, but you have been very ill,” the nurse
informed him. “Lie still and keep quiet.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239'></a>239</span>
</p>
<p>
Dan closed his eyes blissfully. Such luxury
as that with which he was surrounded exceeded
his fondest dreams.
</p>
<p>
From that moment, Dan improved rapidly.
He was able to be up and dressed on the fourth
day, and in another twenty-four hours he was
on deck, where he was provided with a chair
near the stern of the quarter-deck. Sam took
great pleasure in winking at his shipmates when
they passed him, he having remained with
Dan constantly. Sam was enjoying himself
hugely.
</p>
<p>
One morning, soon after, Dan reported that
he felt fit for duty, and asked to be permitted to
return to his post. Sam advised him not to do
so, but in this Dan persisted. However, he did
not return to his post that day, nor for several
days thereafter.
</p>
<p>
That afternoon a muster was called on the
quarter-deck. The Battleship Boys were surprised
when informed that their presence was
required on deck. Upon arriving there, they
were lined up in front of the captain and executive
officer, as if they were to be sentenced after
a court-martial. On each side of them stood
their shipmates, erect, shoulders thrown well
back, each brown face reflecting a poorly-disguised
smile.
</p>
<p>
“Daniel Davis and Samuel Hickey step three
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240'></a>240</span>
paces to the front,” commanded the executive
officer.
</p>
<p>
They did so, wonderingly.
</p>
<p>
The ship’s commander stepped out before
them.
</p>
<p>
“I have here,” he began, “a communication
from the Secretary of the Navy, which I will
read. It is as follows:
</p>
<p>
“‘It is hereby ordered that Ordinary Seaman
Daniel Davis and Ordinary Seaman Samuel
Hickey, at present assigned to the battleship
‘Long Island,’ do present themselves at the executive
mansion in Washington, on the morning
of July twenty-ninth, at eleven o’clock. It is
desired to show proper recognition for their
joint deed of heroism in rescuing, from three
fathoms of water, the ship’s diver, William Kester.
The President is desirous of seeing these
young men in person. It will be his pleasure to
express to them the gratitude of the government
for their splendid achievement. The men will
report in blue dress.’”
</p>
<p>
The Battleship Boys, even now, did not fully
understand what was expected of them, but they
were proud in the thought that they had done
something to merit the praise of their superior
officers.

</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243'></a>243</span></div>
<p>
“You will be put ashore at three o’clock this
afternoon, men. You will take a night train to
Washington and report in accordance with the
instructions as contained in the order just read.
Your shipmates should be proud of you. You
have given all of us a lesson in self-sacrificing
patriotism that we shall do well to bear in mind.
Beside your undaunted bravery, you showed
rare judgment and coolness. These are more
valuable than bravery alone because they direct
bravery. Especially do I wish to commend you,
Davis, for your splendid heroism in rescuing
your shipmate.”
</p>
<p>
The captain came to attention, saluted the two
boys before him, then to the measured beat of
the drum, sailors and marines marched from the
quarter-deck, leaving the two lads standing before
their officers. The jackies looked as if they
would like to cheer the boys, but discipline would
not permit.
</p>
<p>
“My lads, you had better go to your quarters
and prepare for your journey. Ord’ly, tell the
master-at-arms to see that these lads have a
warm meal before they leave the ship this afternoon.
Davis and Hickey, no duties will be required
of you to-day, save to prepare for your
journey. Carry on.”
</p>
<p>
Saluting their commander, the Battleship
Boys executed a right about face and marched
from the deck.
</p>
<p>
“It begins to look as if we were the people,”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244'></a>244</span>
Sam confided to his companion, with a wink after
they had left the quarter-deck behind them.
</p>
<p>
“Two of the people, that’s all, Sam,” corrected
Dan. “You and I are just two boys who
are serving the people under the Stars and
Stripes. Let’s not forget that.”
</p>
<p>
Reaching their quarters they were met by a
shipmate with a message.
</p>
<p>
“Bill Kester wants to see you and the red-head,”
he said.
</p>
<p>
“Is he in the sick bay?” asked Dan
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“I wonder what he wants,” mused Dan, as
they started away.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe he wants to fight us both, now, because
we pulled him out of the brine,” laughed
Sam Hickey.
</p>
<p>
Kester had not improved as rapidly as had
been expected. They found him on a cot in the
sick bay, pale and weak from his terrible experience.
</p>
<p>
“Hello, Bill,” greeted Sam, with a grin.
“How are you feeling to-day?”
</p>
<p>
“Tolerable, shipmates. Dynie, you licked me
didn’t you?” he demanded after a pause, using
the nickname that the men had bestowed upon
Dan.
</p>
<p>
“I’m sorry,” muttered Dan.
</p>
<p>
“I got what I deserved, I did. But I didn’t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245'></a>245</span>
know I had. I swore I’d get even with you. I
said you and me couldn’t stay on the same ship.”
</p>
<p>
“Never mind, that’s all right,” murmured
Dan, at a loss what to say.
</p>
<p>
“It ain’t all right. I’ve got something I
want to say to you. Dynamite, I cut them hammock
lashings.”
</p>
<p>
Kester waited to let his words sink in, but
neither boy made any reply. So the man went
on:
</p>
<p>
“I was mad, crazy mad. I’d have laughed
for joy if I could have seen you both sewn up in
rolls of canvas and dumped overboard with a
flag draped over the sacks. You’ll report me,
I know. They are trying to find out who did it.
Report me. I deserve all I’ll get.”
</p>
<p>
“You are mistaken, Bill, we are not going to
report you,” answered Dan firmly.
</p>
<p>
“You ain’t going to report me?”
</p>
<p>
“Certainly not.”
</p>
<p>
“Then maybe red-head here would like to give
me a wallop on the jaw to even things up.”
</p>
<p>
“No.”
</p>
<p>
“No? What then?”
</p>
<p>
“We are going to shake hands with you, Bill,”
replied Dan. Each boy extended an impulsive
hand. Bill took the hands, gazing keenly into
the bronzed faces as he did so.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve heard all about it,” he muttered. “Yes,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246'></a>246</span>
I’ve heard all about it. They told me to-day,
and—and——”
</p>
<p>
Bill Kester, once the bully of the “Long
Island” buried his face in the pillow. There
was a convulsive upheaval of his shoulders, and
the lads caught what sounded to them like a
sob.
</p>
<p>
“Forget it, Bill,” said Sam awkwardly.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” added Dan; “we didn’t do a thing for
you that you would not have done for either or
both of us, old shipmate. Good-bye, until we
see you a few days from now.”
</p>
<p>
They stole from the room, leaving Bill Kester
to a refreshing sleep, which his relieved conscience
permitted him to take.
</p>
<p>
“I’d have blubbered if I had stayed there another
minute,” muttered Sam Hickey.
</p>
<p>
On the following morning two brown-faced
boys, clad in the blue service uniform of the
United States Navy—one with a bandaged hand—made
their way up Pennsylvania Avenue and
were promptly admitted to the White House.
They were conducted to the East Room, where
were assembled a number of Navy and Army
officers, together with a few other invited
guests.
</p>
<p>
The President entered soon after. He made
straight for the lads with a quick, nervous walk,
grasping the hands of the Battleship Boys impulsively.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247'></a>247</span>
The others in the room now ranged
themselves behind the President.
</p>
<p>
“My lads,” began the Chief Executive, without
loss of time, “I am proud to take you by the
hand. The country too, has reason to be proud
of young men like you. You have shown the
true American spirit. Your signal bravery and
heroic acts should, and will, challenge the admiration
of every one of your countrymen. The
testimony of your officers and of your associates,
who saw your battle for life in your efforts to
rescue a shipmate, leave no question as to your
right to be rewarded by the government. A
special mention is made of you, Davis, to which
I add another of my own. You, though suffering
from broken bones, ill enough to occupy
a place in the sick bay of your ship, went to the
rescue of a drowning comrade. My lads, it
gives me more pleasure than I can express, to
have the privilege of presenting to each of you
a medal of honor, the most highly prized decoration
at the disposal of a grateful republic. That
you will wear these medals with credit there can
be no doubt.”
</p>
<p>
Stepping forward, the President pinned, on
the breast of each lad, the badge that would for
all time mark them out from most of their fellows.
</p>
<p>
“The government,” continued the President,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248'></a>248</span>
resuming his former position, “has provided a
further reward in cases such as yours. To each
of you I present on behalf of the government, a
purse containing one hundred dollars in gold.”
</p>
<p>
The eyes of the Battleship Boys were swimming,
and Sam Hickey’s red hair appeared to
stand up straighter than ever. A warm, cordial
pressure of the hands of the lads by the President
completed the ceremony, after which, each
of the guests stepped forward for a hand shake
and a word of congratulation for the brave boys.
</p>
<p>
Fairly dazed because of these wonderful
things that had come to them, the boys muttered
their thanks and made their way from the White
House as quickly thereafter as was possible.
They were unusually silent as they hurried from
the grounds, wearing their shining gold badges.
Their hearts were too full for words, and each
made a mental resolve that he would serve his
country and his Flag from that moment on with
a devotion which should never fade.
</p>
<p>
The achievements of the Battleship Boys
were not yet at an end. There were other things
ahead of them, far more alluring than any they
had known—thrilling experiences in strange
lands and among strange peoples, and best of
all, promotion in their chosen profession.
</p>
<p>
In a following volume entitled, “<span class='sc'>The Battleship
Boys’ First Step Upward</span>; Or, Winning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249'></a>249</span>
Their Grades as Petty Officers,” the story of
their further exciting adventures on board a
United States man-o’-war will be told, and this
will show more of the fascination and the charm
that ever surround the roving life of the jackie
in Uncle Sam’s Service.

</p>
<p>
By H. Irving Hancock
</p>
<p>
The keynote of these books is manliness. The
stories are wonderfully entertaining, and they are at
the same time sound and wholesome. The plots are
ingenious, the action swift, and the moral tone wholly
healthful. No boy will willingly lay down an unfinished
book in this series, at the same time he will form
a taste for good literature and the glory of right living.

These tales may be aptly described as those of a

deal charmingly and realistically with what is left of
the strenuous outdoor West of the twentieth century.
In every sense they belong to the best class of books

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
